In computer science, the vectors can be ordered list of numbers. Mathematicians consider a more general definition form of vectors. Anything where there is a sensible notion of addition and scalar multiplication can be viewed as vectors. Consider vectors as arrows with its tails sitting at the origin, the coordinates of vectors tells how to get from the tails of vectors to its tip. The addition of vectors is moving along the sum of vectors The scalar multiplication of vectors is scaling the vectors. Consider vectors as ordered lists of numbers, each component of ordered lists of numbers describe how to move parallel to the axes, getting from the tails of vectors to its tip. The addition of vectors is matching up their trems and add each one together. The scalar muliplication of vectors is multiplying each one of their component by that scalar. We usually think of individual vectors as arrows, and think of a set of vectors as points. Linear CombinationsThe linear combination refers to the vector as an operation result of addition and scalar multiplication between multiple vectors. For an arbitrary vector, the vector this coordinate describe is actually the sum of multiple scaled vectors / bases of vectors / unit vectors. The coordinate as scalars describe how each one stretches and squishes vectors / bases of vectors / unit vectors. As a vector, it also has the orginal meaning like the arrow movement or the ordered list of numbers. Any linear combination is relevant to its basis vectors. How to understand linearity? In 2-D linear spaces, fix one of these scalars, and let the other one change its value freely, the tip of resulting vector draws a straight line. The span of vectors refers to what are all the possible vectors we can reach using only these (two) vectors. Linear dependent Whenever we have multiple vectors and we can remove one without reducing the span. One of these vectors could be represented as a linear combination of others, since it is already in the span of the others. Linear independent Each vector add a new dimension to the span. Matrix as Linear TransformationsLinear transformation is a function from a linear space to another linear space. Linear transformation is not called as function because it is to be suggestive of a way to visualize the input-output relation, that is, the movement – move the input vector to output vector. Linear transformation is also called the linear operator, since it can be represented by matrix multiplication, which is an binary operation defined on an algebra. Linear function / Linear funtional refers to a real map which maps a linear space to $\\mathbb{R}$. The movement decribed by the linear transformation has two characteristics. All lines must remain lines, without getting curved. The origin remain fixed. The affine transformation is a movement where the origin moves. In other words, the linear transformation keeps grid lines paraller and evenly spaced. Consider taking every possible input vector to some output vector, it is equivalent to consider every point in space move to some other point. How to decribe one of these linear transformations numerically? Only need to record where the (two) basis vectors each land. Consider a linear transformation$$\\mathbf{i}=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\to L(\\mathbf{i})=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \\\\ -2\\end{matrix}\\right]$$ $$\\mathbf{j}=\\left[\\begin{matrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\\to L(\\mathbf{j})=\\left[\\begin{matrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{matrix}\\right]$$ Since every vector can be decribed as the sum of scaled bases of vectors. Since the linear transfomation moves the basis vectors, then the vector is the sum of scaled new bases of vectors. let’s write this linear transformation in a linear combination form.$$\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right]\\to L(\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right])=x\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \\\\ -2\\end{matrix}\\right]+y\\left[\\begin{matrix}3 \\\\ 0\\end{matrix}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1x+3y \\\\ -2x+0y\\end{matrix}\\right]$$Intuitively, we can write it as a matrix multiplication form for convenience$$\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right]\\to L(\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right])=\\left[\\begin{matrix}L(\\mathbf{i}) &amp; L(\\mathbf{j})\\end{matrix}\\right]\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 &amp; 3\\\\ -2 &amp; 0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\left[\\begin{matrix}x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1x+3y \\\\ -2x+0y\\end{matrix}\\right]$$In conclusion, linear transformation can be decribed using only the coordinates of where each basis vector lands. Matrices give us a language to describe these transformation where the column represent those coordinates. Any metrix-vector multiplication is just a way to compute what that trnsformation does to a given vector. Every matrix can be interpreted as a certain transformation of space. Matrix Multiplication as CompositionMatrix multiplcation is a compostion of linear transformation. Multipliy two matrices has the geometric meaning of applying one transformation then another. The DeterminantThe linear transformation is accompanied by streching or squishing space. To measure exactly how much are things being scretched is equivalent to measure how much are areas scaled. Similarly, we only need to consider the unit square, take 2-D linear space as an example. The very special scaling vector, by whcih a linear transformation changes any area are called the determinant of a transformation. The determinant of a 2-D transformation is 0, if it squishes all sapce onto a line or even onto a single point. Negative determinant imlies orientation-flipping. Linear Equation SystemsAny linear equation system can be written as the form $\\mathbf{Ax}=\\mathbf{y}$, it is equivalent to find a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ after linear transformation $\\mathbf{A}$ lands on $\\mathbf{y}$. To solve the linear equation system, we need to find a inverse linear transformation, which is to find the inverse matrix $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. If the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ doesn’t equal to 0, then we can find a unique $\\mathbf{x}$, which is the unique solution, implying the existence of $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. If the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ equal to 0, for a 2-D linear space, it implies this linear transformation squish the whole space into a line, the solution exists iff $\\mathbf{y}$ lies on this line. $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ doesn’t exist if the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ equal to 0, because we cannot find a inverse linear transformation map a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space, since the linear transformation is a function. For example, we cannot map a point into a line. Let’s review the definition of function: By a function / map $f$ that maps $X$ into $Y$, denoted as $f:X→Y$, we mean a relation $f∈X×Y$ such that For every $x∈X$, there exists a $y∈Y$ such that $xfy$, For every $y,z∈Y$ with $xfy$ and $xfz$, we have $y=z$. The second condition implies we cannot unsquish a linear space. The rank of a matrix is the number of the dimension in the output vector. Since the columns tell us where the basis vector lands after the transformation. The set of all possible outputs of $\\mathbf{Ax}$ is the span of column vectors, called the column space of $\\mathbf{A}$ Rank is actually the dimension of the column space. $\\mathbf{0}$ must lie in the column space since the origin doesn’t change in the linear transformation. For the full rank matrix, only $\\mathbf{0}$ in the input space is mapped into $\\mathbf{0}$. For the non-full rank matrix, multiple vector lands in $\\mathbf{0}$ finally, due to the squishing. These vectors are called the null space or the kernel of the matrix. The null space gives all possible solution to $\\mathbf{Ax=0}$ Eigenvectors and EigenvaluesThe eigenvectors refer to vectors which are not knocked off from its span, or still remain in its span after the linear transformation. The eigenvalues refer to how much the eigenvectors being screched or squished after the liner transformation. This can be represented as equations.$$\\mathbf{Av}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v}\\Longleftrightarrow(\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$$We are interested in non-zero eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}$, which requires $\\mbox{det}(\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda\\mathbf{I})=0$. It means $\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda\\mathbf{I}$ squish non-zero vectors onto $\\mathbf{0}$ Otherwise the null space, which is the solution of $(\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0}$ is unique $\\mathbf{0}$.

Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $F$. $A$ is bounded above if there is an element $M ∈ F$ with the property that if $x ∈ A$, then $x ≤ M$. We call $M$ an upper bound for $A$. $A$ is bounded below if there is an element $m ∈ F$ such that if $x ∈ A$, then $m ≤ x$. We call $m$ a lower bound for $A$. We say that $A$ is bounded if $A$ is bounded above and $A$ is bounded below. Least Upper​ Bound, Greatest Lower Bound: Let $F$ be an ordered field, and let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $F$ which is bounded above. $L ∈ F$ is a least upper bound for $A$ if: $L$ is an upper bound for $A$; if $M$ is any upper bound for $A$, then $L≤M$. The definition of a greatest lower bound is similar with all of the inequalities reversed. The Greatest Lower Bound Property, The Least Upper Bound Property: An ordered field $F$ has the greatest lower bound property if every nonempty subset $A$ of $F$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound. That is, there exists an element $l$ of $F$ such that: $l$ is a lower bound for $A$; if $m$ is any lower bound for $A$ , then $m≤l$. The definition of the least upper bound property is similar. Real Numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$ / Complete Ordered Field: The real numbers are the unique, up to order isomorphism ordered field that satisfies the least upper bound property. We will denote this field by $\\mathbb{R}$. $\\mathbb{R}$ is obtained from $\\mathbb{Q}$ by filling the “holes” in $\\mathbb{Q}$ to obtain an ordered field that satisfies the Completeness Axiom. We thus say that $\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete ordered field. $\\mathbf{R}$, Equivalence Classes in $\\mathcal{C}$: Let $(a_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$, and $(b_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ be Cauchy sequences in $\\mathbb{Q}$. $(a_k){k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ is equivalent to $(b_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$, denoted by $(a_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}} ∼ (b_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$, if $(c_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}= (a_k − b_k){k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ is in $\\mathcal{I}$. The set $\\mathcal{I}$ consists of Cauchy sequences that converge to 0. $∼$ defines an equivalence relation on $\\mathcal{C}$. The set $\\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. $\\mathbf{R}$ is defined as the set of equivalence classes in $\\mathcal{C}$. The equivalent class of $(a_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ is denoted by $[a_k]$. Order Relation on $\\mathbf{R}$: Let $a = [a_k]$, $b = [b_k]$ be distinct elements of $\\mathbf{R}$. We define $a &lt; b$ if $a_k &lt; b_k$ eventually and $b &lt; a$ if $b_k &lt; a_k$ eventually, which is an order relation on $\\mathbf{R}$. Reference Efe A.

If $A⊆B$ but $A\\neq B$, then $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, and write $A ⊂ B$。 Finite, Cardinality, Singleton, Infite: For any set $S$ that contains finitely many elements (in which case we say $S$ is finite), we denote by $|S|$ the total number of elements that $ S$ contains, and refer to this number as the cardinality of $S$. $S$ is a singleton if $|S| = 1$. If $S$ contains infinitely many elements (in which case we say $S$ is infinite), then we write $|S| = ∞$. Empty Set: The set that contains no elements is defined as an empty set, that is,$$∅ := {x : x \\neq x},$$ We have $∅ ⊆ S$ for any set $S$, it implies that $∅$ is unique. If $S \\neq ∅$, we say that $S$ is nonempty. ${∅}$ is a nonempty set. Power Set: We define the class of all subsets of a given set $S$ as $$2^S :={T :T ⊆S},$$ which is called the power set of $S$. Union, Intersection, Difference: Given any two sets $A$ and $B$, The union of $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A ∪ B$, is defined as the set ${x : x ∈ A\\ \\mbox{or} \\ x ∈ B}$. The intersection of $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A ∩ B$, is defined as the set ${x : x ∈ A\\ \\mbox{and}\\ x ∈ B}$. If $A ∩ B = ∅$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. If $A ⊆ B$, then $A∪B = B$ and $A∩B = A$. $∅ ∪ S = S$ and $∅ ∩ S = ∅$ for any set $S$. The difference between $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A\\setminus B$, is defined as the set ${ x : x ∈ A\\ \\mbox{and}\\ x ∈/ B } $. Class, Family, Member: “Class” or “family” refer to a nonempty collection of sets. If $\\mathcal{A}$ is a class, then $\\mathcal{A} \\neq ∅$ and any member $A ∈ \\mathcal{A}$ is a set. The union of all members of this class, $\\bigcup \\mathcal{A}$, $\\bigcup_{A∈\\mathcal{A}}A$, is defined as the set ${x : x ∈ A\\ \\mbox{for some}\\ A ∈ \\mathcal{A}}$. To specify a class $\\mathcal{A}$, we can designate a set $I$ as a set of indices If $I={k,k+1,\\dots, K}$ for some integers $k$ and $K$ with $k&lt;K$, then we often write $\\bigcup^K A_i$, $\\bigcup_{i=k}^KA_i$ for $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$. If $I={k,k+1,\\dots,}$ for some integer $k$, then we may write $\\bigcup^\\infty A_i$, $\\bigcup_{i=k}^\\infty A_i$ for $\\bigcup_{i\\in I}A_i$ The intersection of all sets in $\\mathcal{A}$, $\\bigcap \\mathcal{A}$ , $\\bigcap_{A∈\\mathcal{A}}A$, is defined as the set ${x : x ∈ A\\ \\mbox{for each}\\ A ∈ \\mathcal{A}}$. Ordered Pair: An **ordered pair **is an ordered list $(a,b)$ consisting of two objects $a$ and $ b$. (Cartesian) Product: The (Cartesian) product of $n$ sets $A_1, …, A_n$, is then defined as $$A_1 ×···×A_n :={(a_1,…,a_n):a_i∈A_i, i=1,…,n}.$$ (Binary) Relation: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two nonempty sets. A subset $R$ of $X × Y$ is called a (binary) relation from $X$ to $Y$. Reflexive, Transitive, Symmetric, Antisymmetric, Complete: A relation $R$ on a nonempty set $X$ is said to be reflexive if $xRx$ for each $x ∈ X$ **transitive **if $xRy$ and $yRz$ imply $xRz$ for any $x,y,z ∈ X.$ **symmetric **if, for any $x, y ∈ X$, $xRy$ implies $yRx$, antisymmetric if, for any $x, y ∈ X$, $xRy$ and $yRx$ imply $x = y$. complete if either $xRy$ or $yRx$ holds for each $x,y ∈ X$. Equivalence Relation, Equivalence Class: A relation $∼$ on a nonempty set $X$ is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. For any $x ∈ X$, the equivalence class of $x$ relative to $∼$ is defined as the set$$[x]_∼ :={y∈X:y∼x}.$$ Let $X$ be a set. An equivalence relation on $X$ is a relation $R$ on $X$ such that (Reflexive) For all $x ∈ X$, $x ∼ x$. (Symmetric) For $x,y∈X$, if $x∼y$ then $y∼x$. (Transitive) For $s,y,z∈X$, if $x∼y$ and $y∼z$, then $x∼z$. Preorder, Partial order, Linear order: A relation $\\succsim$ on a nonempty set $X$ is called a **preorder **on $X$ if it is transitive and reflexive. $\\succsim$ is said to be a **partial order **on $X$ if it is an antisymmetric preorder on $X$. $\\succsim$ is called a **linear order **on $X$ if it is a partial order on $X$ which is complete. By a preordered set we mean a list $(X, \\succsim)$ where $X$ is a nonempty set and $\\succsim$ is a preorder on $X$. If $\\succsim$ is a partial order on $X$, then $(X, \\succsim)$ is called a poset (short for partially ordered set) If $\\succsim$ is a linear order on $X$, then $(X, \\succsim)$ is called either a chain or a loset (short for linearly ordered set). Function / Map: By a function / map $f$ that maps $X$ into $Y$, denoted as $f:X→Y$, we mean a relation $f∈X×Y$ such that For every $x∈X$, there exists a $y∈Y$ such that $xfy$, For every $y,z∈Y$ with $xfy$ and $xfz$, we have $y=z$. $X$ is the domain of $f$ and $Y$ the codomain of $f$. The range of $f$ is$$f(X):={y∈Y :xfy\\ \\mbox{for some}\\ x∈X}.$$ The set of all functions that map $X$ into $Y$ is denoted by $Y^X$ or $f : X → Y$ . When $ f(x) = y$, we refer to $y$ as the image or value of $x$ under $f$. Composition: Given functions $f : X → Z$ and $g : Z → Y$, The composition of $f$ and $g$ is the function $g◦f : X → Y$, where $g◦f(x) := g(f(x))$. $(g ◦ f )(x)$ is usually written as $g ◦ f (x$). Surjection, Injection, Bijection: If its range equals its codomain, that is, if $f(X) = Y$, then one says that $f$ maps $X$ onto $Y$, and refers to it as a surjection. If $f$ maps distinct points in its domain to distinct points in its codomain, that is, if $x\\neq y$ implies $f(x) \\neq f(y)$ for all $x,y ∈ X$, then we say that $f$ is an injection. If $f$ is both injective and surjective, then it is called a bijection. Self-map, Identity Function: A function whose domain and codomain are identical, that is, a function in $X^X$, is called a self-map on $X$. The identity function is a self-map on $X$, denoted as $\\mbox{id}_X$, and defined as $\\mbox{id}_X (x) := x$ for all $x ∈ X$. $\\mbox{id}_X$ is a bijection. Binary Operation: Let $X$ be any nonempty set. We refer to a function of the form $• : X ×X → X$ as a binary operation on $X$, and write $x•y$ instead of $•(x,y)$ for any $x, y ∈ X$. Field: Let $X$ be any nonempty set, let $+$ and $·$ be two binary operations on $X$. The list $(X, +, ·)$ is called a field if the following properties are satisfied: (Closure) $x+y\\in X$ and $xy\\in X$ for all $x,y∈X$; (Commutativity) $x+y=y+x$ and $xy=yx$ for all $x,y∈X$; (Associativity) $(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$ and $(xy)z = x(yz)$ for all $x,y,z ∈ X$; (Existence of Identity Elements) There exist elements $0$ and $1$ in $X$ such that $0 + x = x = x + 0$ and $1x = x = x1$ for all $x ∈ X$; (Existence of Inverse Elements) (the additive inverse of $x$) For each $x ∈ X$, there exists an element $−x$ in $X$ such that $x+−x = 0 = −x+x$, and (the multiplicative inverse of $x$) For each $x ∈ X\\backslash{0}$, there exists an element $x^{−1}$ in $X$ such that $xx^{−1} = 1 = x^{−1}x$. (Distributivity) $x(y + z) = xy + xz$ for all $x, y, z ∈ X$; (Cancellation) If $xz=yz$ and $z\\neq0$ then $x=y$ for all $x,y,z ∈ X$; A field without the multiplicative inverse of $x$ and cancellation rule for the multiplication is a commutative ring with 1. Ordered Field: The list $(X,+,·,≥)$ is called an ordered field if $(X,+,·)$ is a field, and if $≥$ is a partial order on $X$ such that (Addition) If $x,y,z\\in X$, and $x\\leq y$, then $x+z\\leq y+z$ (Multiplication by nonnegative elements) If $x,y,z\\in X$, and $x\\leq y,\\ 0\\leq z$ then $xz\\leq yz$ The list $(X,+,·,&lt;)$ is called an **ordered field** if $(X,+,·)$ is a field, and if $&lt;$ is a relation on $X$ such that (Trichotomy) If $x,y\\in X$, then $x&lt;y,\\ x=y$ or $x&gt;y$ (Transitivity) If $x,y\\in X$, and $x&lt;y,\\ y&lt;z$, then $x&lt;z$ (Addition) If $x,y,z\\in X$, and $x&lt;y$, then $x+z&lt;y+z$ (Multiplication by postive elements) If $x,y,z\\in X$, and $x&lt;y,\\ 0&lt;z$ then $xz&lt;yz$ We adopt the following notation: $$X_+ :={x∈X :x≥0}\\ and\\ X_{++} :={x∈X :x&gt;0},$$ $$X_− :={x∈X :x≤0}\\ and\\ X_{−−} :={x∈X :x&lt;0}.$$ Absolute Value, The Triangle Inequality: Let $(X, +, ·, ≥)$ be an ordered field. The function $|·| : X → X$ defined by $$|x|:=\\left{\\begin{matrix}x,&amp;if\\ x\\geq0\\-x,\\ &amp;if\\ x &lt;0\\end{matrix}\\right.$$ is called the absolute value function. The following is called the triangle inequality: $$|x+y|≤|x|+|y|\\ \\ \\ for\\ all\\ x,y∈X.$$ It is valid within any ordered field. Propositions and TheoremsProposition 2: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two nonempty sets. A function $f ∈ Y^X$ is invertible if, and only if, it is a bijection. Proposition 3: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two nonempty sets. A function $f ∈ Y^X$ is invertible if, and only if, there exists a function $g∈X^Y$ such that $g◦f=\\mbox{id}_X$ and $f◦g=\\mbox{id}_Y$. Proposition 6: (The Archimedean Property) For any $(a, b) ∈ \\mathbb{R}_{++} × \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $m ∈\\mathbb{N}$ such that $b &lt; ma$. For any $a, b ∈ \\mathbb{R}$ such that $a &lt; b$, there exists a $q ∈\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a &lt; q &lt; b$. Reference Efe A.

The “geometric” way of thinking about continuity depends intrinsically on the “distance” between two points. For the continuity of functions defined on more complicated sets, the meaning of the term “close” is not transparent. Therefore, need the conception of distance between two elements of an arbitrary set By way of abstraction, the notion of distance function is built only on three properties. These properties are strong enough to introduce to an arbitrary nonempty set a geometry rich enough to build a satisfactory theory of continuous functions. DefinitionsMetric: Let $X$ be any nonempty set. Let $X$ be any nonempty set. A function $d : X × X → \\mathbb{R}_+$ that satisfies the following properties is called a distance function or a metric on $X$: For any $x, y, z ∈ X$, (Positive Definite) $d(x,y)=0$ iff $x=y$, (Symmetry) $d(x, y)=d(y, x)$, (Triangle Inequality) $d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y)$. Metric Space: If $d$ is a distance function on $X$, we say that $(X, d)$ is a metric space, and refer to the elements of $X$ as points in $(X, d)$. Metric Subspace: If $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $∅\\neq Y ⊂X$. $(Y, d|_{Y ×Y} )$, or simply $Y$, is a metric subspace of $X$ $d$ is called the inherited metric. Sequence: A sequence in a nonempty set $X$ is a function $f : \\mathbb{N }→ X$, This function is represented as $(x_1,x_2,…)$ where $x_i := f(i)$ for each $i ∈ \\mathbb{N}$. The set of all sequences in $X$ is $X^{\\mathbb{N}}$ or $X^∞$. Subsequence: A subsequence of a sequence $f ∈ X^\\mathbb{N}$ is a function of the form $f ◦σ$ where $σ :\\mathbb{N} → \\mathbb{N}$ is strictly increasing That is, $σ(k) &lt; σ(l)$ for any $k,l ∈ N$ with $k &lt; l$. This function is represented as the array $(x_{m_1},x_{m_2},…)$ with $m_k = σ(k)$ and $x_{m_k} = f(m_k)$ for each $k = 1,2,….$ Increasing, Decreasing, Monotonic: A real sequence $(x_m)$ is said to be increasing if $x_m ≤ x_{m+1}$ for each $m ∈\\mathbb{N}$, and strictly increasing if $x_m &lt; x_{m+1}$ for each $m ∈\\mathbb{N}$. It is said to be (strictly) decreasing if $(−x_m)$ is (strictly) increasing. A real sequence which is either increasing or decreasing is referred to as a monotonic sequence. Convergent Sequence: A sequence $(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ of points is a convergent sequence in a metric spaces $X$ if, given any real number $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists an integer $N_\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n \\geq N_\\varepsilon$, then $d(a_n, L) &lt; \\varepsilon$. $L$ is called the sequitial limit. Cauchy Sequence: A sequence $(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence in a metric spaces $X$ if, given any real number $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists an integer $N_\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n, m \\geq N_\\varepsilon$, then $d(a_n, a_m) &lt; \\varepsilon$. Intuitively speaking, by a Cauchy sequence we mean a sequence the terms of which eventually get arbitrarily close to one another. Subsequential Limit: Given any $(x_m) ∈ \\mathbb{R}^∞$, we say that $x ∈ \\overline{\\mathbb{R}} $ is a subsequential limit of $(x_m)$ if there exists a subsequence $(x_{m_k} )$ with $x_{m_k} → x$ as $k → ∞$ That is, if, for any $ε&gt;0$, there exists a $K∈\\mathbb{N} $ such that $ |x_m −x|&lt;ε$ for all $k≥K$. Limit Supremum, Limit Infimum: Let $(a_k)_{k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence of real numbers. For each $n ∈ \\mathbb{N}$, define $b_n = \\sup{a_k | k ≥ n}$, and $c_n = \\inf{a_k | k ≥ n}$. We define the limit supremum of the sequence $(a_k){k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ to be $\\lim{n→∞} b_n$, and we denote this by $\\lim \\sup_{k→∞} a_k$. We define the limit infimum of $(a_k){k∈\\mathbb{N}}$ similarly: $\\lim \\inf{k→∞} a_k = \\lim_{n→∞} c_n$. Propositions and TheoremsYoung’s Inequality: Suppose $a,b\\geq 0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose $p,q\\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $p,q&gt;1$ such that $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q} = 1$. Then$$ab\\leq\\frac{a^p}{p}+\\frac{b^q}{q}$$ Theorem 3.2.7: (Hölder’s Inequality) Suppose $x = (x_1,x_2,…,x_n) ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $y = (y_1,y_2,…,y_n) ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n$ Suppose $p,q\\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $p,q&gt;1$ such that $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q} = 1$.

It is designed to disabuse people of the notion that every metric looks like the usual metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The discrete metric is very handy for producing counterexamples. $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_p) =\\mathbb{R}^{n,p}=\\ell^p_n(\\mathbb{R})$ For each $1≤p≤∞$, where $d_p :\\mathbb{R}^n×\\mathbb{R}^n →\\mathbb{R}+$ is defined by$$d_p(x, y) := |x-y|_p=\\left(\\sum^n{i=1}|x_i − y_i|^p \\right)^{\\frac1{p}}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for}\\ \\ 1 ≤ p &lt; ∞,$$ and $$d_p(x,y):=\\max{|x_i −y_i|:i=1,…,n}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for}\\ \\ p=∞.$$ $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_p)$ is not a metric space for $p &lt; 1$. $(\\ell^p, d_p)$: For any $1 ≤ p &lt; ∞$, we define$$\\ell^p :={(x_m)∈\\mathbb{R}^∞ : \\sum^∞_{i=1} |x_i|^p &lt;∞}.$$ and $d_p : \\ell^p × \\ell^p → \\mathbb{R} _+$ is defined by$$d_p ((x_m) , (y_m)) := \\left(\\sum^\\infty_{i=1}|x_i − y_i|^p\\right)^\\frac1{p} .$$ Any $\\ell^p$ space is smaller than the set of all real sequences $\\mathbb{R}^∞$ since the members of such a space are real sequences that are either bounded or that satisfy some form of a summability condition (that ensures that $d_p$ is real-valued). Indeed, no $d_p$ defines a distance function on the entire $\\mathbb{R}^∞$. $(\\ell^\\infty, d_\\infty)$: $\\ell^∞$ is the set of all bounded real sequences,$$\\ell^∞ :={(x_m)∈\\mathbb{R}^∞ :\\sup{|x_m|:m∈\\mathbb{N}}&lt;∞}.$$ and $d_∞ : \\ell^∞ ×\\ell^∞ → \\mathbb{R} _+$ is defined by $$d_∞ ((x_m) , (y_m)) := |x_m − y_m|_∞=\\sup{|x_m − y_m| : m ∈ \\mathbb{N}}.$$ This metric is called the sup-metric on the set of all bounded real sequences. $(\\mathbf{B}(T), d_\\infty)$: Let $T$ be any nonempty set. $\\mathbf{B}(T)$ is the set of all bounded real functions defined on $T$,$$\\mathbf{B}(T):={f ∈\\mathbb{R}^T :\\sup{|f(x)|:x∈T}&lt;∞}.$$ and $d_∞ : \\mathbf{B}(T) ×\\mathbf{B}(T ) → \\mathbb{R}_+$ is defined by$$d_∞ (f, g) := |f − g|_∞=\\sup{|f (x) − g(x)| : x ∈ T }.$$ An $n$-vector or a sequence can always be thought of as special functions $\\mathbf{B}({1, …, n})$ coincides with $\\mathbb{R}^{n,∞}$ (for any $n ∈ \\mathbb{N}$) $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbb{N})$ coincides with $\\ell^∞$. Every continuous function on $[a, b]$ is bounded, and hence $\\mathbf{C}[a, b] ⊆\\mathbf{B}[a, b]$. Consequently, we can consider $\\mathbf{C}[a, b]$ as a metric subspace of $\\mathbf{B}[a, b]$.

In many problems where finiteness makes life easier (such as in optimization problems), compactness does the same thing. DefinitionsCover, Open Cover: Let $X$ be a metric space and $S ⊆ X$. A class $\\mathcal{O}$ of subsets of $X$ is said to cover $S$ if $S⊆\\cup\\mathcal{O}$. If all members of $\\mathcal{O}$ are open in $X$, then we say that $\\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover of $S$. Compact: A metric space $X$ is said to be compact if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subset that also covers $X$. A subset $S$ of $X$ is said to be compact in $X$ if every open cover of $S$ has a finite subset that also covers $S$. If $S$ is a compact subset of a metric space $Y$, and $Y$ is a metric subspace of $X$, then $S$ is compact in $X$. $(0, 1)$ is not a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R} $ (or that $(0, 1)$ is not a compact metric space). A finite subset of any metric space is necessarily compact. Much less trivially, $[0,1]$ is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R} $. Sequentially Compact: A subset $S$ of a metric space $X$ is sequentially compact iff, every sequence in $S$ has a subsequence that converges to a point in $S$. Since the closedness property can be characterized in terms of convergent se- quences (Proposition 1). Given that every compact space is closed, it makes sense to ask if it is possible to characterize compactness in the same terms as well. So it comes to the sequentially compactness. Sequentially compactness is a stronger condition than closedness. If a subset is sequentially compact, then it is closed. Sequentially compactness is a stronger condition than completeness. If a subset is sequentially compact, then it is complete. Totally Bounded, Precompact: A set $S$ in a metric space $X$ totally bounded (or precompact) if, for any $ε &gt; 0$, there exists a finite subset $T$ of $S$ such that $S ⊆ {N_{ε,X}(x) : x ∈ T}$. This property is strictly more demanding than boundedness. Every totally bounded subset of a metric space is bounded. Propositions and TheoremsProposition 4: Any closed subset of a compact metric space $X$ is compact. Theorem 3.6.4 / Proposition 5: Any compact subset of a metric space $X$ is closed and bounded. Compactness is, in general, a stronger property than closedness and boundedness put together; it often introduces significantly more structure to the analysis. Corollary 3.6.5 If $A$ is a compact set in a metric space $X$, then every infinite subset of $A$ has an accumulation point in $A$. Corollary 3.6.6 Let $A$ be a compact set in a metric space. Then, every infinite sequence in $A$ has a subsequence that converges to a point in $A$. Corollary 3.6.5 is equivalent to corollary 3.6.6. Lemma 1: Every sequentially compact subset of a metric space $X$ is totally bounded. Lemma 3.6.16: Let $X$ be a metric space. If $A ⊂ X$ has the property that every infinite subset of $A$ has an accumulation point in $X$, then there exists a countable collection of open sets ${U_i | i ∈ \\mathbb{N}}$ such that, if $V$ is any open set in $X$ and $x ∈ A ∩ V$ , then there is some $U_i$ such that $x ∈ U_i ⊂ V$ . Lemma 2: Let $X$ be a metric space. If $A ⊂ X$ has the property that every infinite subset of $A$ has an accumulation point in $X$, then for every open cover of $A$, there is a finite subcover. Let $S$ be a sequentially compact subset of a metric space $X$, and $\\mathcal{O}$ an open cover of $S$. Then there exists an $ε&gt;0$ such that, for any $x∈S$, we can find an $O_x ∈\\mathcal{O}$ with $N_{ε,X}(x) ⊆ O_x$.

Intuitively speaking, a connected subset of a metric space is one that cannot be partitioned into two (or more) separate pieces, it is rather in one whole piece. DefinitionsConnected: A metric space $X$ is connected if there do not exist two nonempty and disjoint open subsets $O$ and $U$ of $X$ such that $ O ∪ U = X$. A subset $S ⊆ X$ is connected in $X$ iff it cannot be written as a disjoint union of two nonempty sets that are open in $S$.

Connected Component, Totally Disconnected: If $X$ is a metric space and $x_0\\in X$ The connected component of $x_0$ in $X$ is the union of the connected sets that contain $x_0$.

Suppose that $X$ is not connected, then we can find nonempty and disjoint open subsets $O\\neq X$ and $X\\setminus O$ such that $O \\cup (X\\setminus O) = X$. Since $O$ is open, then $X\\setminus O$ is closed, so it is a clopen set. Since the only clopen subsets of $X$ are $\\emptyset$ and $X$, contradiction! Examples and ExercisesExercise 3.6.35, Example 3.6.45: A discrete metric space $X$ is totally disconnected. A subset of a discrete metric space is connected iff its cardinality is at most 1. Discrete metric spaces only have isolated points, if its cardinality is 2, then take two points $a,\\ b$, and consider $B_\\varepsilon(a),\\ B_\\varepsilon(b)$, where $\\varepsilon&lt;1$. According to the proposition 2, a discrete space is not connected unless it contains only one element, because any subset of the discrete space is clopen. Exercise 3.6.35: A finite subset of any metric space is connected iff its cardinality is at most 1. If its cardinality is 2, then take two points $a,\\ b$, and consider $B_\\varepsilon(a),\\ B_\\varepsilon(b)$, where $\\varepsilon=\\frac{d(a,b)}{2}$ or $\\varepsilon=\\frac{d(a,b)}{3}$.

A subset $A$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ in the usual metric is connected iff $A$ is an interval. Proof We first prove that any interval $I$ is connected in $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose $ I = O \\cup U$ and $O$ and $U$ are nonempty and disjoint open subsets of $I$. Let $a\\in O$ and $b\\in U$ and $a &lt; b $. Let $c=\\sup{t\\in O:t&lt;b}$, note that $a\\leq c\\leq b$ so we have $c\\in I$. If $c\\in O$, then $c\\notin U$ and $c \\neq b$, so $c&lt;b$. Since $c$ is the least upper bound, then for any $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we have $b \\in B_\\varepsilon(c) $, then there exists an $\\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that $B_\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}(b)\\in B_\\varepsilon(c)\\subseteq O$. Contradiction! We then prove that any connected set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is an interval. Suppose $I$ is a nonempty connected set in $\\mathbb{R}$ but not an interval. Then there exist two points $a$ and $b$ in $I$ such that $(a,b)\\setminus I\\neq\\emptyset$. Let $c\\in (a,b)\\setminus I$, $O= I \\cap (-\\infty,c)$ and $U= I \\cap (c, \\infty)$. Then $O$ and $U$ are nonempty and disjoint open subsets of $I$ such that $O \\cup U = I$. Contradiction! Exercise 3.6.35: A convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual metric is a connected set. Proof: Assume that a convex set $A⊂\\mathbb{R}^n$ is disconnected. Then for some open sets $O,U$, we have $O∪U=A$. Consider some $o∈O$ and $u∈U$. Define $L$ as the line segment connecting $u$ and $v$. Thus, $u∈O∩L≠∅$ and $v∈U∩L≠∅$. Since $A$ is convex, $L⊂A$. Then $(O∩L)∩(V∩L)⊂O∩U=∅$, so $(O∩L)∩(U∩L)=∅$. Furthermore, $(O∪U)∩L=A∩L=L$, so $(O∩L)∪(U∩L)=L$. As a metric subspace $L$ is open, since $O,\\ U$ are both open, so $O∩L, U∩L$ are nonempty disjoint open sets. Thus, $L$ is disconnected. Or assume that a convex set $A⊂\\mathbb{R}^n$ is disconnected. Then for some open sets $U,V$, we have, $U∩A≠∅$ and $V∩A≠∅$, $(U∩A)∩(V∩A)=∅$, and $(U∩A)∪(V∩A)=A$. Consider some $u∈(U∩A)$ and $v∈(V∩A)$. Define $L$ as the line segment connecting $u$ and $v$. Thus, $u∈U∩L≠∅$ and $v∈V∩L≠∅$. Since $A$ is convex, $L⊂A$. Then $(U∩L)∩(V∩L)⊂(U∩A)∩(V∩A)=∅$, so $(U∩L)∩(V∩L)=∅$. Furthermore, $((U∩A)∪(V∩A))∩L=A∩L=L$, so $((U∩A)∩L)∪((V∩A)∩L)=(U∩L)∪(V∩L)=L$. Thus, $L$ is disconnected. Choose $f:\\mathbb{R}→\\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as $f(t)=(1−t)u+tv$ (where $u$ and $v$ are the previously chosen points in $\\mathbb{R}^n$). Let $\\varepsilon&gt;0$ and let $a∈\\mathbb{R}$. Choose $δ=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{||v−u||}$ which is greater than 0. Then if $|t−a|&lt;δ$, we have $$ \\begin{aligned}||f(t)−f(a)||&amp;=||(1−t)u+tv−(1−a)u−av||\\&amp;=||(a−t)u+(t−a)v||\\&amp;=||(t−a)v−(t−a)u||\\&amp;=|t−a|⋅||v−u||\\&amp;&lt;δ||v−u||\\&amp;=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{||v−u||}||v−u||\\&amp;=\\varepsilon \\end{aligned}$$ Thus, $f$ is continuous at $a$. Since $a$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continuous. Since $[0,1]$ is an interval, it is connected. Thus, since $f$ is continuous and $f([0,1])=L$, $L$ is connected. Contradiction. Exercise 3.6.41: Connected components are closed. Proof: Suppose $A$ is connected, $\\overline{A}$ is a disconnected, then $\\overline{A}$ can be written as two disjoint nonempty sets $O$ and $U$ that are open in $\\overline{A}$ . Suppose $O\\cap A\\neq \\emptyset$ and $A\\nsubseteq O$, then $A$ can be written as two disjoint nonempty sets $O\\cap A$ and $U\\cap A$ which are open in $A$, contradiction! Thus $O\\cap A=\\emptyset$ or $A\\subseteq O$. Since $O\\cap U= \\emptyset$ and $O\\cup U=A\\cup A’$. Hence if $O\\cap A=\\emptyset$, we have $A\\subseteq U$, if $A\\subseteq O$, we have $U\\cap A=\\emptyset$, we only need to show one of these cases is impossible. Suppose $U\\cap A=\\emptyset$ and $A\\subseteq O$, then $U\\subseteq A’$, take any $a_0\\in U\\subseteq A’$, then $a_0$ is an accumulation point of $A$. Since $U$ is open, we have for some $r&gt;0$, $B_r(a_0)\\subseteq U\\subseteq A’$ Since $A\\subseteq O$, $O\\cap U=\\emptyset$, so $U\\cap A=\\emptyset $ $a_0\\notin A$, then for some $r&gt;0$, ${B_r(a_0)\\setminus a_0}\\subseteq U\\subseteq A’$ and ${B_r(a_0)\\setminus a_0}\\cap A=\\emptyset $ contradicts with the definition of accumulation points. Thus $\\overline{A}$ is connected. Since $A$ and $\\overline{A}$ are both the connected subsets containing $x_0$, their union is $\\overline{A}$ which is closed. Or directly the connected component is itself a metric subspace, which is closed. Reference Efe A. Ok, 2005, “Real Analysis with Economic Applications”; John Boller and Paul J.

Intuitively speaking, one may think of a separable metric space as a space which is “not very large.” After all, in such a space, there is a countable set which is “almost” equal to the entire space. DefinitionsDense, Separable: Let $X$ be a metric space and $Y ⊆ X$. If $cl_X(Y) = X$, then $Y$ is said to be dense in $X$ . $X$ is said to be separable if it contains a countable dense set. A set $Y ⊆ X$ is dense in a metric space $X$ iff, any point in $X$ can be approached by means of a sequence that is contained entirely in $Y$. So, $X$ is a separable metric space iff, it contains a countable set $Y$ such that $x ∈ X$ iff there exists a $(y_m) ∈ Y^∞$ with $y_m → x$ This is also equivelant to say $Y\\subseteq X$ and $X$ contains all the accumulation points of $Y$. In any metric space $X$, $X$ is dense in $X$. Propositions and TheoremsExample 6: Any metric subspace of a separable metric space is separable. Theorem 3.6.29: If $(X, d)$ is a compact metric space, then $X$ is separable. Proof: For each $n ∈ \\mathbb{N}$, consider the collection of open balls $\\mathcal{O}={B_{\\frac{1}{n}}(x) | x ∈ X}$.

Prove that $x$ is the accumulation point of $S$ by showing that $y\\in {B_r(y)\\setminus {y}}\\cap S$.

That is,$$cl_{\\mathbf{C}[a,b]}(\\mathbf{P}[a, b]) = \\mathbf{C}[a, b].$$ Proposition 3: Let $X$ be metric space. If $X$ is separable, then there exists a countable class $\\mathcal{O}$ of open subsets $X$ such that $$U= {O∈\\mathcal{O}:O⊆U}$$ for any open subset $U$ of $X$ One major reason for why separable metric spaces areseful is that in such spaces all open sets can be described in terms of a countable set of open sets. Keep in mind that many interesting properties of a metric space are defined through the notion of an open set. For instance, if we know all the open subsets of a metric space, then we know all the closed and/or connected sets in this space. Similarly, if we know all the open subsets of a metric space, then we know which sequences in this space are convergent and which ones are not. Consequently, a lot can be learned about the general structure of a metric space by studying the class of all open subsets of this space. But the significance of this observation would be limited, if, in a sense, we had “too many” open sets lying around. In the case of a separable metric space this is not the case, for such a space has only a countable number of open sets “that matter” in the sense that all other open subsets of this space can be described using only these (countably many) open sets. This is the gist of Proposition 3. Examples and ExercisesExercise 3.6.26, Example 6: The only dense subset of $X$ is $X$ itself iff, $X$ is a discrete metric space. A discrete space is separable iff it is countable. Example 3.6.25, Example 6: $\\mathbb{R}^{n,p}$ is separable for any $1 ≤ p ≤ ∞$. $\\mathbb{Q}^n$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the usual metric.

If $(x^m)$ is convergent, then it is Cauchy. If $(x^m)$ is Cauchy, then ${x_1,x_2,…}$ is bounded, but $(x_m)$ need not converge in $X$. If $(x^m)$ is Cauchy and has a subsequence that converges in $X$, then it converges in $X$ as well. Proposition 7: Let $X$ be a metric space, and $Y$ a metric subspace of $X$. If $Y$ is complete, then it is closed in $X$. If $Y$ is closed in $X$ and $X$ is complete, then $Y$ is complete. Corollary 1: A metric subspace of a complete metric space $X$ is complete iff, it is closed in $X$. **Theorem 1.1.6, Theorem 1.1.8 **: (The Least Upper Bound Property in $\\mathbb{R}$, The Completeness Axiom) Every nonempty subset in $\\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound.

If $r ∈ \\mathbb{R}$, with $r &gt; 0$, The open ball of radius $r$ around $x_0$ is $B_r(x_0) = {x ∈ X | d(x,x_0) &lt; r}$. The closed ball of radius $r$ around $x_0$ is $B_r(x_0)={x∈X|d(x,x_0)≤r}$. The open ball is never empty, for it contains $x$. Neighborhood: For any $x ∈ X$ and $ε &gt; 0$, the $ε$-neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ $$N_{ε,X} (x) := {y ∈ X : d(x, y) &lt; ε}.$$ A neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ is any subset of $X$ that contains at least one $ε$-neighborhood of $x$ in $X$. It is the same with the open ball. The $ε$-neighborhood of $x$ in a metric space $X$ depends on $ε$ and $x$. And it also depends on the set $X$ and the distance function $d$ used to metrize this set. Open Set, Closed Set, Bounded Set: A subset $S$ of $X$ is said to be open in $X$ if, for each $x ∈ S$, there exists an $ε &gt; 0$ such that $N_{ε,X}(x) ⊆ S$. A subset $S$ of $X$ is said to be closed in $X$ if $X\\setminus S$ is open in $X$. A subset $S$ of $X$ is said to be bounded in $X$ if there is a point $x \\in X$ and $r &gt; 0$ such that $S\\subseteq B_r(x)$ or $X = \\emptyset$. The open ball is inherently connected to the underlying metric space, so does the notions of open and closed sets. Changing the metric on a given set, or concentrating on a metric subspace of the original metric space, would in general yield different classes of open (and hence closed) sets. For any $x ∈ X$ the open ball is open, and the set ${x}$ is closed. It is possible for a set in a metric space to be neither open nor closed. The structure of the mother metric space is crucial. $\\mathbb{Q}$ is neither closed nor open in $(\\mathbb{R},d)$ while it is noth closed and open in $(\\mathbb{Q},d)$ Clopen: The sets which are both open and closed are sometimes called clopen. In any metric space $X$, the sets $X$ and $∅$ are both open and closed. Any subset of a discrete space is clopen. Accumulation Point, Isolated Point, Boundary Point: Let $X$ be a metric space, $x_0 \\in X$, $S \\subseteq X$.

A point $x_0 ∈ X$ is an isolated point of $S$ if, there exists an $r &gt; 0$ such that $B_r(x_0) \\cap S = {x_0}$.

Above definitions are equivalent to each other. Interior, Closure, Boundary: Let $X$ be a metric space and $S ⊆ X$. The largest open set in $X$ that is contained in $S$ is the interior of $S $ (relative to $X$), and is denoted by $int_X(S)$.$$int_X(S)=\\bigcup{O∈\\mathcal{O}_X :O⊆S},$$ where $\\mathcal{O}_X$ is the class of all open subsets of $X$ The smallest closed set in $X$ that contains $S$ is the closure of $S$ (relative to $X$), and is denoted by $cl_X(S)$.$$cl_X(S)=\\bigcap{C\\in\\mathcal{C}_X:S\\subseteq C}$$ where $\\mathcal{C}_X$ is the class of all closed subsets of $X$ The boundary of $S$ (relative to $X$), denoted by $bd_X(S)$, is defined as$$bd_X (S) := cl_X (S)\\setminus int_X (S).$$ Let $X$ be a metric space, and $Y$ a metric subspace of $X$. For any subset $S$ of $Y$, $int_X(S)$, could be different from $int_Y(S)$. Consider $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The same with the closure and the boundary operators. It is obvious that a set $S$ in a metric space $X$ is closed iff $cl_X(S) = S$. $S$ is open iff $int_X(S) = S$. $x ∈ bd_X(S)$ iff $S ∩ N_{ε,X}(x)$ and $(X\\setminus S) ∩ N_{ε,X}(x)$ are nonempty for any $ε &gt; 0$.

A function $f ∈ Y^X$ is uniformly continuous if, for all $ε &gt; 0$, there exists a $δ &gt; 0$ such that if $x,y ∈ X$ with $d(x,y)&lt;\\delta$, then $d’(f(x),f(y))&lt;\\varepsilon$. A function $f ∈ Y^X$ is uniformly continuous if, for all $ε &gt; 0$, there exists a $δ &gt; 0$ such that $f(N_{δ,X}(x)) ⊆ N_{ε,Y} (f(x))$ for all $x ∈ X$. The notion of continuity is an inherently local one. Uniform continuity says something about the behavior of $f$ on its entire domain, not only in certain neighborhoods of the points in its domain. Obviously, a uniformly continuous function is continuous. On the other hand, a continuous function need not be uniformly continuous. Homeomorphism: If $f ∈ Y^X$ is a bijection, and both $f$ and $f^{−1}$ are continuous, then it is called a **homeomorphism **between $X$ and $Y$. If there exists such a bijection, then we say that $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic Two homeomorphic spaces are indistinguishable from each other insofar as their neighborhood structures are concerned. If $X$ and $ Y $ are homeomorphic, then corresponding to each open set $O$ in $X$, there is an open set $f(O)$ in $Y $, and conversely, corresponding to each open set $U$ in $Y$, there exists an open set $f^{−1}(U)$ in $X$. Therefore, loosely speaking, $Y$ possesses any property that $X$ possesses so long as this property is defined in terms of open sets. Such a property is called a topological property. Formally, a property for metric spaces is referred to as a topological property if it is invariant under any homeomorphism, that is, whenever this property is true for $X$, it must also be true for any other metric space that is homeomorphic to $X$. Connectedness is a topological property. The same goes for separability and compactness as well. Neither completeness nor boundedness are preserved by a homeomorphism — these are not topological properties. Thus, there are important senses in which two homeomorphic metric spaces may be of different character. Isometry: $f ∈ Y^X$ is an isometry if $f$ is a homeomorphism that preserves the distance between any two points, that is, if$$d_Y (f(x),f(y)) = d(x,y)\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all} \\ \\ \\ \\ x,y ∈ X,$$ Then we may conclude that the spaces $(X, d)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ are indistinguishable as metric spaces — one is merely a relabelling of the other. In this case, $X$ and $Y$ are said to be isometric. Hölder Continuous For any $α &gt; 0$, a function $f ∈ Y^X$ is said to be $α$-Hölder continuous, if there exists a $K &gt; 0$ such that $$d_Y (f(x),f(y)) ≤ Kd(x,y)^α \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ \\ \\ \\ x,y ∈ X.$$ It is called **Hölder continuous **if it is $α$-Hölder continuous for some $α &gt; 0$. Lipschitz Continuous, Lipschitz Constant Lipschitz continuous is $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous with $\\alpha=1$, that is, if there exists a $K &gt; 0$ such that$$d_Y (f(x),f(y)) ≤ Kd(x,y)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ \\ \\ \\ x,y ∈ X.$$ The smallest such $K$ is called the Lipschitz constant of $f$. Contraction, Nonexpansive: Contraction (or a contractive map) is Lipschitz Continuous with $0 &lt; K &lt; 1$ , that is, if there exists a $0&lt;K&lt;1$ such that$$d_Y (f(x),f(y)) ≤ Kd(x,y)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ \\ \\ \\ x,y ∈ X,$$ and nonexpansiveif$$d_Y (f(x),f(y)) ≤ d(x,y)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ \\ \\ \\ x,y ∈ X.$$ The latter two definitions generalize the corresponding contraction which applied only to self-maps. For a self-map$f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is Lipschitz continuous if its derivative is bounded, It is nonexpansive if $\\sup{|f’(t)| : t ∈ \\mathbb{R} } ≤ 1$ It is a contraction if $\\sup{|f’(t)| : t ∈ \\mathbb{R} } ≤ K &lt; 1$ for some real number $K$.$$\\begin{aligned}\\mbox{contraction}&amp;\\Rightarrow\\mbox{nonexpansiveness}\\Rightarrow\\mbox{Lipschitz continuity}\\Rightarrow\\mbox{Hölder continuity}\\Rightarrow\\mbox{uniform continuity}\\Rightarrow\\mbox{continuity}\\end{aligned}$$ Propositions and TheoremsTheorem 3.5.5, Proposition 1: For any metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ , and $ f ∈ Y^X$ , the following statements are equivalent: $f$ is continuous; For every open subset $O$ of $Y$, the set $f^{−1}(O)$ is open in $X$; For every closed subset $S$ of $Y$, the set $f^{−1}(S)$ is closed in $X$; For any $x∈X$ and $(x_m )∈X ,x^m→x$ implies $f(x^m )→f(x)$. Corollary 3.5.6: Suppose that $(X,d),\\ (X’,d’),$ and $(X’’,d’’)$ are metric spaces, and $f : X → X’$ and $g:X’→X’’$ are continuous. Then $g◦f:X→X’’$ is continuous. Theorem 3.5.16: Suppose $1 ≤ p &lt; q ≤ ∞$. Then the identity map $I(x) = x$ from $\\ell^p_n(\\mathbb{R})$ to $\\ell^q_n(\\mathbb{R})$ is a homeomorphism. Examples and ExercisesExample: Given two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, if $f ∈ Y^X$ is continuous and $S$ is a metric subspace of $X$, then $f|_S$ is a continuous function. Example 1: The identity function $id_X$ on a metric space $X$ is continuous A constant function on any metric space is continuous. Example: Any function defined on a discrete space is continuous. Example: Any polynomial function on $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric is continuous. For every $n ∈ \\mathbb{N}$, any concave or convex function defined on an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is continuous. Example: The function $\\varphi : \\ell^∞ → \\mathbb{R}_+$ defined by $\\varphi((x_m)) := \\sup{|x_m| : m ∈ \\mathbb{N}}$ is continuous. Example: The function $L ∈ \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbf{C}[0,1]}$ defined by $L(f):=\\int^1_0f(t)dt$ is continuous. Example: The continuous function $f : \\mathbb{R}_{++} →\\mathbb{R}_{++} $ defined by $f(x) := \\frac{1}{x}$ is continuous but not uniform continuous. For the continuous function $f : \\mathbb{R} →\\mathbb{R} $. If $f’(x)$ exists, and it is bounded, then $f(x)$ is uniform continuous. $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. A polynomial function $p(x)$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous iff $\\deg(p(x)) &lt; 2$. Any linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is uniformly continuous. Example: $[0,1)$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}_+$. $x \\mapsto \\frac{x}{1-x}$ is a homeomorphism between $[0, 1)$ and $\\mathbb{R}^+$. $\\mathbb{R} $ and $(\\mathbb{R}, d’)$ are homeomorphic, where $d’(x, y) :=\\frac{|x−y|}{1+|x-y|} $. The identity map is a homeomorphism. $\\mathbb{R}^{n,p}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{n,q}$ are homeomorphic for any $n ∈ \\mathbb{N} $ and $1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞$. Example: $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ and $[−1, 1]$ are isometric Example: $f(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(x+\\frac{2}{x})$, $x\\in[1,\\infty)$ is a contraction. Consider its derivative, which is always less than 1. Exercise 3.7.3: Let $f : \\mathbb{R} → \\mathbb{R}$ be a polynomial function. $f$ is a contraction if $0&lt;|a_1|&lt;1$. Consider the derivative, which is always less than 1 if $0&lt;|a_1|&lt;1$. Exercise 3.7.2, Exercise 3.7.9: A contraction mapping is continuous. Proof: Let $X$ be a metric space and $f$ a map from $X$ to $X$ and $d(f(x),f(y)) ≤ αd(x,y)$, $x,y\\in X$, $0 &lt; α &lt; 1$. For any $\\varepsilon&gt;0$, for any $x_0,x\\in X$, let $\\delta=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\alpha}$, if $d(x_0,x)&lt;\\delta$, then $d(f(x_0),f(x))\\leq\\alpha d(x_0,x)&lt;\\alpha\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\alpha}=\\varepsilon$. Thus any contraction mapping is continuous. A Lipschitz continuious function is continuous. Proof: Let $X$ be a metric space and $f$ a map from $X$ to $X$ and $d(f(x),f(y)) ≤ Cd(x,y)$, $x,y\\in X$. For any $\\varepsilon&gt;0$, for any $x_0,x\\in X$, let $\\delta=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}$, if $d(x_0,x)&lt;\\delta$, then $d(f(x_0),f(x))\\leq C d(x_0,x)&lt;C\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}=\\varepsilon$. Thus any Lipschitz continuous function is continuous. Reference Efe A. Ok, 2005, “Real Analysis with Economic Applications”; John Boller and Paul J.

An important subspace of $\\mathbf{B}(T)$ consists of all continuous and bounded functions on $T$, denoted by $\\mathbf{CB}(T)$ or $\\mathbf{BC}(T)$. The set of all continuous functions on $T$ is denoted as $\\mathbf{C}(T)$. While the sup-metric cannot be used to metrize $\\mathbf{C}(T)$ in general (because a continuous function need not be bounded), this complication disappears when $T$ is compact. For then, by Corollary 2, we have $\\mathbf{CB}(T ) = \\mathbf{C}(T )$. When $T$ is compact, therefore, we can, and we will, think of $\\mathbf{C}(T)$ as metrized by the sup-metric. Pointwise Convergence: Let $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions in $\\mathbf{B}(T)$. We say that a function $f : X → \\mathbb{R}$ is the pointwise limit of the sequence $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ if, for every $x ∈ X$, $\\lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) = f(x)$. Uniformly Convergence: Let $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions in $\\mathbf{B}(T)$. The sequence is said to converge uniformly to a function $f ∈ \\mathbf{B}(T)$ provided that, given $ε &gt; 0$, $∃N_ε ∈ \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\sup_{x∈X}|f_n(x) − f(x)| &lt; ε$ for $n ≥ N_ε$. Uniform convergence is strictly more demanding than the perhaps more familiar notion of pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions Uniform convergence, being a “global” (i.e. $x$-independent) statement, implies the pointwise convergence which is a “local” ($x$-dependent) condition. Separate Points: Let $A$ be a collection of functions from a set $X$ to $F$. The collection $A$ separates points if, for every pair of distinct points $x_1,x_2 ∈ X$, there is a function $f ∈ A$ such that $f(x_1)\\neq f(x_2)$. Real Polynomial Function: A real polynomial function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n → \\mathbb{R}$ is a finite linear combination of expressions of the form $x_1^{m_1}, x_2^{m_2},\\dots, x_n^{m_n} $ where $m_1, m_2 ,\\dots , m_n$ , are non-negative integers. The coefficients of a polynomial may be taken from $\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Q}$, or $\\mathbb{R}$. The resulting set of polynomials is denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}[x_1, . . . , x_n], \\mathbb{Q}[x_1, . . . , x_n]$, and $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, . . . , x_n]$, respectively. Lattice: Let $V$ be a vector space of real valued continuous functions on a metric space $X$. $V$ is a lattice if $|f|∈V$ whenever $f∈V$. Propositions and TheoremsTheorem 3.4.23 : The spaces $\\mathbf{B}(T)$ is a complete metric space. Proposition 7 / Theorem 3.5.26 : For any metric space $T$, $\\mathbf{CB}(T)$ is a complete metric subspace of $\\mathbf{B}(T )$. Dini’s Theorem: Let $T$ be a compact metric space, $φ ∈ \\mathbf{C}(T)$ and $(φ_m)$ a sequence in $\\mathbf{C}(T)$. If $φ_m \\searrow φ$ (or $φ_m\\nearrow φ$), then $φ_m →φ$ uniformly. Lemma 3.8.11: Let $A$ be an algebra of real-valued, continuous functions on a compact metric space $X$. Then, for $f ∈ A$, $|f|$ is in the uniform closure of $A$. That is, there is a sequence $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ in $A$ such that $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly to $|f|$. Lemma 3.8.14: Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $L$ a lattice of continuous functions on $X$. Suppose that, for any $x,y∈X$ with $x\\neq y$ and $a,b∈\\mathbb{R}$ , there is a function $f_{xy} ∈L$ satisfying $f_{xy}(x)=a$ and $f_{xy}(y) = b$. Then, for each $f ∈ \\mathbf{C}(X)$, there is a sequence $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ in $L$ such that $(f_n)_{n∈\\mathbb{N}}$ converges uniformly to $f$. Theorem 3.8.8: (Stone) Let $X$ be a compact metric space. Let $A$ be an algebra of continuous, real valued functions on $X$, and suppose that $A$ separates points. Then $\\overline{A}$, the closure of $A$ in $\\mathbf{C}(X,\\mathbb{R})$ under the sup metric, sometimes called the uniform closure of $A$, either coincides with $\\mathbf{C}(X,\\mathbb{R})$ or with $\\mathbf{C}x_0 (X, \\mathbb{R}) = {f ∈ \\mathbf{C}(X,\\mathbb{R}) | f(x_0) = 0}$, for some point $x_0 ∈ X$. The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem. Take any compact metric space $T$ , and let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a subset of $\\mathbf{C}(T)$ with the following properties: $αφ + βψ ∈ \\mathcal{P}$ for all $φ, ψ ∈ \\mathcal{P}$ and $α, β ∈ \\mathbb{R} $; $φψ ∈ \\mathcal{P}$ for all $φ,ψ ∈ \\mathcal{P}$; all constant functions belong to $\\mathcal{P}$; for any distinct $x, y ∈ T$, there exists a $φ$ in $\\mathcal{P}$ such that $φ(x) \\neq φ(y)$. Then $\\mathcal{P}$ is dense in $\\mathbf{C}(T)$. Above two thoermes are the same. Theorem 3.8.7: (Weierstrass) Let $A$ be a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then every continuous function $f : A → \\mathbb{R}$ is the uniform limit of a sequence of real polynomials in $\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$. Proof: $\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$ on $A$ is an algebra that separate points, by the Stone’s Theorem, $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]}=\\mathbf{C}(A)$. This means that for any $f\\in \\mathbf{C}(A)$, either $f\\in \\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$ or $f$ is an accumulation point of $\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$. If $f$ is an accumulation point of $\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$, then there is a sequence $(f_n)\\in\\mathbb{R}[x_1 , . . . , x_n ]$ such that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f_n=f$ in the sup norm, which means that $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ uniformly.

Indeed, $f(x)=x$ is continuous and injective so $f(x_1)\\neq f(x_2)$ for all $x_1\\neq x_2$. In fact, even the set of polynomial functions separates points.

Geometrically, these are thought of as points in space, where the $p_i$’s give the coordinates of the point $\\mathbf{p}$. At the same time, we may consider $n$-tuples of real numbers as $n$-dimensional vectors giving the data of a direction and a magnitude, without specifying a base point from which this vector emanates. Thinking this way, we see that such vectors are elements of a vector space, $\\mathbb{E}^n$, where elements can be written as $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,…,v_n)$, with each $v_i ∈ \\mathbb{R}$. We will consistently distinguish between the “points” of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and “vectors” in $\\mathbb{E}^n$, since geometrically they are quite different. Vectors are free to wander around in space, and points have to stay where they are. vector + vector = vector, point + vector = point, point − point = vector DefinitionsAlgebra: Let $F$ be a field. An algebra over $F$ is a set $A$ such that $A$ is a vector space over $F$ and $A$ has an internal law of composition $◦$ satisfying the associative law, and left and right distributivity. That is, for $a,b,c ∈ A$, we have (Associativity) $a ◦ (b ◦ c) = (a ◦ b) ◦ c$, (Left Distributivity) $a ◦ (b + c) = (a ◦ b) + (a ◦ c)$ and (Right Distributivity) $(a + b) ◦ c = (a ◦ c) + (b ◦ c)$. For scalar multiplication we have for $α ∈ F$ , $(α · a) ◦ b = α · (a ◦ b) = a ◦ (α · b)$. An algebra $A$ is an algebra with identity if there is an element $\\mathbf{1} ∈ A$ so that $a◦\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{1}◦a = a$ for all $a ∈ A$. The algebra $A$ is a commutative algebra if $a ◦ b = b ◦ a$ for all $a, b ∈ A$. Line: Let $\\mathbf{p}_0$ be a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ be a direction in $\\mathbb{E}^n$. The line $\\ell$ through $\\mathbf{p}_0$ in the direction $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\\ell=\\{\\mathbf{p}∈\\mathbb{R}^n |\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{p}_0 +t\\mathbf{v}, t∈\\mathbb{R}\\}$. Plane: Suppose that $\\mathbf{p}_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{E}^n$. The plane through $\\mathbf{p}_0$ spanned by $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ is $\\mathcal{P} = {\\mathbf{p} ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n | \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{p}_0 + t\\mathbf{v} + s\\mathbf{w}, t, s ∈ \\mathbb{R}}$. Affine Subspace, Hyperplane: If $\\mathbf{v}_1, . . . , \\mathbf{v}_k$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{E}^n$, then we define the $k$-dimensional affine subspace through $\\mathbf{p}_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned by $\\mathbf{v}_1, . . . , \\mathbf{v}_k$ as $\\mathbf{H}=\\{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n |\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{p}_0+t_1\\mathbf{v}_1+…+t_k\\mathbf{v}_k,\\ \\mbox{where}\\ t_j ∈\\mathbb{R},1≤j≤k\\}$. The collection of vectors $\\{t_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + … + t_k\\mathbf{v}_k,\\ t_j ∈ \\mathbb{R}\\}$ is actually a subspace of $\\mathbb{E}^n$. Thus, a $k$-dimensional affine subspace is constructed by taking a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{E}^n$ and adding it to a point of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. When $k=n−1$, $\\mathbf{H}$ is called a hyperplane in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Parallelogram: If $\\mathbf{v}_1, . . . , \\mathbf{v}_k$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{E}^n$, and $\\mathbf{p}_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, we define the $k$-dimensional parallelepiped with vertex $\\mathbf{p}_0$ spanned by $\\mathbf{v}_1, . . . , \\mathbf{v}_k$ as $\\mathbf{P} = {\\mathbf{p} ∈ \\mathbb{R}^n | \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{p}_0 + t_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + . . . + t_k\\mathbf{v}_k,\\ \\mbox{with}\\ 0 ≤ t_j ≤ 1}$. Note that if $k = n = 2$ then $\\mathbf{P}$ is just a standard parallelogram in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Bilinear Form: Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ . A bilinear form $⟨·, ·⟩$ on $V$ is a map $⟨·, ·⟩ : V × V → F$ which satisfies linearity in both variables. That is, for all $\\mathbf{v},\\ \\mathbf{v}_1,\\ \\mathbf{v}_2,\\ \\mathbf{w},\\ \\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 ∈V$, and all $α∈F$, $⟨\\mathbf{v}_1 +\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{w}⟩=⟨\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{w}⟩+⟨\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{w}⟩ $ $⟨α\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩ = α⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩$ $⟨\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}_1 +\\mathbf{w}_2⟩=⟨\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}_1⟩+⟨\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}_2⟩ $ $⟨\\mathbf{v}, α\\mathbf{w}⟩ = α⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩$. The form $⟨·, ·⟩$ is said to be symmetric if $⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩ = ⟨\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{v}⟩$ for all $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} ∈ V$ . Positive Definite: Let $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$. The bilinear form $⟨·, ·⟩$ is said to be positive definite if $⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{v}⟩ ≥ 0$ for all $\\mathbf{v} ∈ V$ , and $⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{v}⟩ = 0$ iff $\\mathbf{v} = 0$. Scalar Product, Dot Product: Suppose that $\\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{v}_1,…,\\mathbf{v}_n)$ and $\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{w}_1,…,\\mathbf{w}_n)$ are vectors in $\\mathbb{E}^n$. The scalar product of $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ is $⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩ = \\mathbf{v}_1\\mathbf{w}_1 + . . . + \\mathbf{v}_n\\mathbf{w}_n$. The scalar product is sometimes called the dot product and is denoted by $\\mathbf{v}· \\mathbf{w}$. Length, Norm: If $\\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{v}_1,…,\\mathbf{v}_n) ∈ \\mathbb{E}^n$, then the length or norm of $\\mathbf{v}$ is defined by $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|=\\sqrt{⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{v}⟩}=(v_1^2+\\dots+v_n^2)^\\frac{1}{2}$ Orthogonal, Mutually Orthogonal: Let $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} ∈ \\mathbb{E}^n$. Then $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are said to be orthogonal if $⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩ = 0$. A set $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1,…,\\mathbf{v}_n\\}$ of vectors in $\\mathbb{E}^n$ is said to be mutually orthogonal or pairwise orthogonal if $⟨\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j ⟩ = 0$ for all pairs $i,j$ with $i\\neq j$. Propositions and TheoremsTheorem 2.5.12: (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) Let $\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w} ∈ \\mathbb{E}^n$ . Then $|⟨\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}⟩| ≤ \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$.

Null Space, Kernel: The set $L^{−1}(0)$ is called the null space (or the kernel) of $L$, and is denoted by $null(L)$, that is, $$null(L):={x∈X :L(x)=0}.$$ Linear Funtional: A real-valued linear operator is referred to as a **linear functional **on $X$. The set of all linear operators from a linear space $X$ into a linear space $Y$ is denoted as $\\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$. So, $L$ is a linear functional on $X$ iff $L ∈ \\mathcal{L}(X,\\mathbb{R} )$. Linear Correspondence: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two linear spaces, and $Γ : X \\rightrightarrows Y$ a correspondence. We say that $Γ$ is a linear correspondence if $$αΓ(x) ⊆ Γ(αx)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ Γ(x) + Γ(x’) ⊆ Γ(x + x’)$$ for all $x, x’ ∈ X$ and $α ∈ \\mathbb{R} $. Linear Function: Let $S$ be a nonempty subset of a linear space $X$, and denote by $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. A real map $φ ∈ \\mathbb{R}^S$ is linear if $$φ\\left(\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in A}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}\\right) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in A}λ(\\mathbf{x})φ(\\mathbf{x})$$ for any $A∈\\mathcal{P}(S)$ and $λ∈\\mathbb{R}^A $ such that $\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}∈A}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}∈S$. Affine Function: Let $S$ be a nonempty subset of a linear space $X$, and denote by $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. A real map $φ ∈ \\mathbb{R}^S$ is called affine if $$φ\\left(\\sum_{x\\in A}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}\\right) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in A}λ(\\mathbf{x})φ(\\mathbf{x})$$ for any $A∈\\mathcal{P}(S)$ and $λ∈\\mathbb{R}^A$ such that $\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}∈A}λ(\\mathbf{x})=1$ and $\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}∈A}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}∈S$. Linear Isomorphism: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two linear spaces and $L ∈ \\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$. If $L$ is a bijection, then it is called a linear isomorphism between $X$ and $Y$, and we say that $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic. Just like two isometric metric spaces are indistinguishable from each other insofar as their metric properties are concerned, the linear algebraic structures of two isomorphic linear spaces coincide. Put differently, from the perspective of linear algebra, one can regard two isomorphic linear spaces as differing from each other only in the labelling of their constituent vectors. It is quite intuitive that a finite dimensional linear space can never be isomorphic to an infinite dimensional linear space. But there is more to the story. Given the interpretation of the notion of isomorphism, you might expect that the dimensions of any two isomorphic linear spaces must in fact be identical. Closed Halfspace, Open Halfspace: Given Corollary 4, we may identify a hyperplane $H$ in a linear space $X$ with a real number and a nonzero linear functional $L$ on $X$. This allows us to give an analytic form to the intuition that a hyperplane “divides” the entire space into two parts. In keeping with this, we refer to either one of the sets$${x∈X :L(x)≥α}\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ {x∈X :L(x)≤α}$$ as a closed halfspace induced by $H$, and to either one of the sets$${x∈X :L(x)&gt;α}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ {x∈X :L(x)&lt;α}$$ as an open halfspace induced by $H$. Propositions and TheoremsLemma 1: Let $T$ be a subset of a linear space with $\\mathbf{0} ∈T$. Then $φ∈\\mathbb{R}^T $ is affine iff, $φ − φ(\\mathbf{0} )$ is a linear real map on $T$ . It is important to note that this fact remains true even if the domain of the affine map is not a linear space. Proposition 4: Let $n∈\\mathbb{N} $ and $∅\\neq S⊆\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $φ∈\\mathbb{R}^S$ is affine iff, there exist real numbers $α_1, …, α_n, \\beta$, such that $φ(x) =\\sum^n α_ix_i + β$ for all $x ∈ S$. Proposition 5: Two finite dimensional linear spaces are isomorphic iff, they have the same dimension. Corollary 3: Every nontrivial finite dimensional linear space is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, for some $n ∈ \\mathbb{N} $. Proposition 6: Let $Y$ be a subset of a linear space $X$. Then, $Y$ is a $⊇$-maximal proper linear subspace of $X$ iff,$$Y = null(L)$$ for some nonzero linear functional $L$ on $X$. Corollary 4: A subset $H$ of a linear space $X$ is a hyperplane in $X$ iff, $$H ={x∈X :L(x)=α}$$ for some $α ∈ \\mathbb{R} $ and nonzero linear functional $L$ on $X$. Reference Efe A.

For any two distinct vectors $x$ and $y$ in the linear space $X$, we think of the set ${λx+(1−λ)y ∈ X : λ ∈ \\mathbb{R} }$ as the line through $x$ and $y$. The set ${λx+(1−λ)y ∈ X :0 ≤ λ ≤ 1}$ corresponds to the line segment between $x$ and $y$. A subset $S$ of $X$ is is convex iff it contains the entire line segment between any two of its elements. The affine hull of a convex set can in general be expressed much more easily than that of a nonconvex set. Indeed, for any convex subset $S$ of a linear space, we simply have$$aff (S) = {λx + (1 − λ)y : λ ∈ \\mathbb{R} \\mbox{ and } x, y ∈ S}.$$ Convex Hull: Let $S$ be any set in a linear space $X$, and let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the class of all convex subsets of $X$ that contain $S$. We have $ \\mathcal{S}\\neq∅$ — after all, $X∈\\mathcal{S}$. $\\bigcap \\mathcal {S}$ is a convex set in $X$ which contains $S$. This set is the smallest (that is, $⊇$-minimum) subset of $X$ that contains $S$ — it is called the convex hull of $S$, and denoted by $co(S)$. The closed convex hull is the intersection of all closed convex set containing $S$ It is worth noting that the definition of $co(S)$ uses vectors that lie outside $S$ (because the members of $S$ may well contain such vectors). For this reason, this definition can be viewed as an external one. We may also characterize $co(S)$ internally, that is, by using only the vectors in $S$. $co(S)$ is the set of all convex combinations of finitely many members of $S$. That is, $$co(S)=\\left\\{\\sum^m_{i=1}\\lambda_ix^i:m\\in\\mathbb{N},\\ x^1,\\dots,x^m\\in S\\ \\mbox{and}\\ (\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_m)\\in[0,1]^m \\mbox{ and } \\sum^m_{i=1}\\lambda_i=1 \\right\\}$$ $S = co(S)$ iff $ S$ is convex. Moreover, for any $x, y ∈ X$, we see that $co({x, y})$ — which is denoted simply as $co{x,y}$ henceforth — is nothing but the line segment between $x$ and $y$, and we have$$co(S) = \\bigcup{co(T ) : T ∈ \\mathcal{P}(S)},$$where $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. Concave Function, Convex Function: Let $X$ be a linear space and $T$ a nonempty convex subset of $X$. A real map $φ$ on $T$ is called concave if $$φ(λx+(1−λ)y)≥λφ(x)+(1−λ)φ(y)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ \\ \\ \\ x,y∈T\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and} \\ \\ \\ \\ 0≤λ≤1,$$ while it is called convex if $−φ$ is concave. If both $φ$ and $−φ$ are concave, then $φ$ is an affine map Cone, Convex Cone: A nonempty subset $C$ of a linear space $X$ is said to be a **cone **if it is closed under nonnegative scalar multiplication, that is, $λC ⊆ C$ for all $λ ≥ 0$, i.e.$$λx∈C\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for any}\\ \\ \\ x∈C\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ λ≥0.$$ If $C$ is, in addition, closed under addition, that is, $C + C ⊆ C$, i.e.$$x+y∈C\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for any}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x,y∈C,$$ then it is called a convex cone. We say that a cone $C$ in $X$ is pointed if $C ∩ −C ={\\mathbf{0} }$, generating if $\\mbox{span}(C) = X$, and nontrivial if $C \\neq {\\mathbf{0}}$. Geometrically speaking, a cone is a set that contains all rays that start from the origin and pass through another member of the set. In turn, a convex cone is none other than a cone which is also convex set. In a manner of speaking, the concept of convex cone lies in between that of a convex set and that of a linear subspace. Any linear subspace $C$ of a linear space $X$ is a convex cone. The smallest (i.e. $⊇$-minimum) convex cone in a linear space $X$ is the trivial linear subspace ${\\mathbf{0}}$ while the largest (i.e. $⊇$-maximum) convex cone is $X$ itself. Moreover, if $C$ is a convex cone in this space, so is $−C$. If $X$ and $Y$ are two linear spaces, and $L∈\\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$, then ${x∈X:L(x)≥\\mathbf{0}}$ is a (pointed) convex cone in $X$. All of these cones are infinite dimensional and generating. Conical Hull: Let $S$ be any nonempty set in a linear space $X$. It is easily checked that $S$ is a convex cone in $X$ iff $\\sum_{x∈T} λ(x)x ∈ S$ for any nonempty finite subset $T$ of $S$ and $λ ∈ \\mathbb{R}^T_+$. It follows that the smallest convex cone that contains $S$ — the **conical hull **of $S$ — exists and equals the set of all positive linear combinations of finitely many members of $S$. Denoting this convex cone by $cone(S)$, therefore, we may write $$cone(S)=\\left\\{\\sum_{x\\in T}λ(x)x:T ∈\\mathcal{P}(S)\\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ λ∈\\mathbb{R}^T_+\\right\\}$$ where, as usual, $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ stands for the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. By convention, we let $cone(∅) = {\\mathbf{0} }$ Propositions and TheoremsExamples and ExercisesExamples: Note that $\\mathbb{Q} $ is a midpoint convex subset of $\\mathbb{R} $ which is not convex. Indeed, a nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is convex iff it is an interval. In any linear space $X$, all singleton sets, line segments and lines, along with $∅$, are convex sets. Any linear subspace, affine manifold, hyperplane or half space in $X$ is also convex. Examples: Both ${f∈\\mathbf{C}^1[0,1]:f≥0}$ and $C:={f∈\\mathbf{C}^1[0,1]:f’ ≥0}$ are convex cones in $\\mathbf{C}^1[0, 1]$. The former one is pointed, but the latter is not — all constant functions belong to $C ∩ −C$. Examples: For any $n ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, $cone(\\mathbb{R}^n_{++}) = \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}∪ {\\mathbf{0}}$ and $cone({\\mathbf{e}^1, …, \\mathbf{e}^n}) = \\mathbb{R}^n_+$, where ${\\mathbf{e}^1, …, \\mathbf{e}^n}$ is the standard basis for $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

A \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ is a nonempty collection of subsets of $X$ that is closed under complementation and taking countably infinite unions. In particular, there is no difference between an algebra and a \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra when the ground set $X$ under consideration is finite. More generally, every finite algebra on $X$ is a \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ By the de Morgan Law, an $\\sigma$-algebra on $X$ is closed under taking finite intersections.

Event, Event Space: Given a \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra \u0006$\\Sigma$ on $X$, the intuitive concept of an “event“ is formalized as any \u0006$\\Sigma$-measurable set in $X$. That is, we say that $A$ is an event if and only if $A\\in\\Sigma$ , and for this reason a $\\sigma$\u001b-algebra on $X$ is often referred to as an event space on $X$.

Example: if $X := {a,b,c}$,then $\\alpha(\\emptyset) = \\alpha({\\emptyset}) = \\alpha({X}) = {\\emptyset,X}$ $\\alpha({\\emptyset, X, {a}}) = {\\emptyset,X,{a},{b,c}}$ $\\alpha({\\emptyset,X,{a},{b}}) = 2^X$ Example 1.5: By definition, $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}) = \u001b(\\mathcal{O}_\\mathbb{R})$; but one does not actually need all open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ for generating $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ For instance, what if we used instead the class of all open and bounded intervals, call it $\\mathcal{A}_1$, then $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}_1)=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. $\\mathcal{A}_2:=$ the set of all closed and bounded intervals $\\mathcal{A}_3:=$ the set of all closed sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ $\\mathcal{A}_4:=$ the set of all bounded intervals of the form $(a, b]$ $\\mathcal{A}_5:=$ the set of all intervals of the form $(-\\infty,a]$ $\\mathcal{A}_5:=$ the set of all intervals of the form $(-\\infty,a)$ All of these collections generate the same \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra, namely, $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ For any metric space $X$, $\\mathcal{B}(X):=\\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_X)=\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}_X)$.

For any group $(X, +)$, and any nonempty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$, we let$$A + B := {x + y : (x, y) ∈ A × B}$$ Linear Space, Vector Space: Let $X$ be a nonempty set. The list $(X,+,·)$ is called a linear space (or vector space) if $(X, +)$ is an Abelian group, and if $·$ is a mapping that assigns to each $(λ,\\mathbf{x}) ∈ \\mathbb{R} ×X$ an element $λ·\\mathbf{x}$ of $X $ such that, for all $α, λ ∈ \\mathbb{R} $ and $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} ∈ X$, we have (Closure) $λ\\mathbf{x}\\in X$ (Associativity) $α(λ\\mathbf{x}) = (αλ)\\mathbf{x}$; (Distributivity) $(α+λ)\\mathbf{x}=α\\mathbf{x}+λ\\mathbf{x}$ (Distributivity) $λ(\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{y})=λ\\mathbf{x}+λ\\mathbf{y}$; (Existence of an identity element) $1\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}$. Let $(X,+,·)$ be a linear space, and $A,B ⊆ X$ and $λ ∈ \\mathbb{R} $. Then,$$A+B:={x+y:(x,y)∈A×B}\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ λA:={λx:x∈A}.$$ For simplicity, we write $A + y$ for $A + {y}$, and similarly, $y + A := {y} + A$. Linear spaces provide an ideal structure for a proper investigation of convex sets. We use the notation $X$ instead of $(X,+,\\cdot)$ for a linear space, but we should always keep in mind that what makes a linear space “linear” is the two operations defined on it. Two different types of addition and scalar multiplication operations on a given set may well endow this set with different linear structures, and hence yield two very different linear spaces. Addition, Scalar Multipulation, Origin, Zero, Vector: In a linear space $(X,+,·)$, the mappings $+$ and $·$ are called addition and scalar multiplication operations on $X$, respectively. The identity element $\\mathbf{0} $ is called the origin (or zero), and any member of $X$ is referred to as a vector. If $\\mathbf{x} ∈ X\\backslash {0}$, then we say that $x$ is a nonzero vector in $X$. Linear Subspace, Proper Linear Subspace: Let $X$ be a linear space and $∅ \\neq Y ⊆ X$. If $Y$ is a linear space with the same operations of addition and scalar multiplication as with $X$, then it is called a **linear subspace **of $X$. If, further, $Y \\neq X$, then $Y$ is called a proper linear subspace of $X$. Affine Manifold, Hyperplane: A subset $S$ of a linear space $X$ is said to be an affine manifold of $X$ if $S=Z+\\mathbf{x}^*$ for some linear subspace $Z$ of $X$ and some vector $\\mathbf{x}^* ∈X$. If $Z$ is a $⊇$-maximal proper linear subspace of $X, S$ is called a hyperplane in $X$. Equivalently, a hyperplane is a $⊇$-maximal proper affine manifold. A good way of thinking intuitively about the notion of affinity in linear analysis is this: affinity = linearity + translation. Since we think of $\\mathbf{0} $ as the origin of the linear space $X$ — this is a geometric interpretation; don’t forget that the definition of $\\mathbf{0} $ is purely algebraic — it makes sense to view a linear subspace of $X$ as untranslated (relative to the origin of the space), for a linear subspace “passes through” $\\mathbf{0} $. The following simple but important observation thus gives support to our informal equation above: An affine manifold $S$ of a linear space $X$ is a linear subspace of $X$ iff $\\mathbf{0} ∈ S$. An immediate corollary of this is: If $S$ is an affine manifold of X, then $S −x$ is a linear subspace of $X$ for any $x ∈ S$. Moreover, this subspace is determined independently of $x$, because if $S$ is an affine manifold, then$$S−x=S−y\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for any}\\ \\ \\ x,y∈S.$$ Linear Combination, Affine Combination, Positive Linear Combination, Convex Combination: For any $m ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, by a linear combination of the vectors $\\mathbf{x}^1,…,\\mathbf{x}^m$ in a linear space $X$, we mean a vector $\\sum^m λ_i\\mathbf{x}^i ∈ X$, where $λ_1, …, λ_m$ are any real numbers. If we have $\\sum^m\\lambda_i=1$, then $\\sum^m\\lambda_i\\mathbf{x}^i$ is referred to as an affine combination of the vectors $\\mathbf{x}^1,…,\\mathbf{x}^m$. If $\\lambda_i\\geq0$ for each $i$, then $\\sum^m\\lambda_i\\mathbf{x}^i$ is called a positive linear combination of $\\mathbf{x}^1,…,\\mathbf{x}^m$. If $\\lambda_i\\geq0$ for each $i$ and $\\sum^m\\lambda_i=1$, then $\\sum^m\\lambda_i\\mathbf{x}^i$ is called a convex combination of $\\mathbf{x}^1,…,\\mathbf{x}^m$. Equivalently, a linear (affine (convex)) combination of the elements of a nonempty finite subset $T$ of $X$ is $\\sum_{x\\in T}\\lambda(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}$, where $\\lambda\\in \\mathbb{R}^T$. (and $\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in T}\\lambda(\\mathbf{x})=1$ (and $\\lambda(T)\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}_{+}$)). Span / Linear Hull: The set of all linear combinations of finitely many members of a nonempty subset $S$ of a linear space $X$ is called the span / linear Hull of $S$ in $X$, and is denoted by $span(S)$. That is, for any $∅ \\neq S ⊆ X$, $$span(S):= \\left\\{λ_i\\mathbf{x}^i :m∈\\mathbb{N}\\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ (\\mathbf{x}^i,λ_i)∈S×\\mathbb{R}, i=1,…,m \\right\\},$$ or equivalently,$$span(S)=\\left\\{\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in T}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}:T ∈\\mathcal{P}(S)\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ λ∈\\mathbb{R}^T\\right\\}$$ where $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. By convention, we let $span(∅) = \\{\\mathbf{0} \\}$. $span(S)$ is the smallest (i.e. $ ⊇$-minimum) linear subspace of the mother space that contains $S$. Especially when $S$ is finite, this linear subspace has a very concrete description in that every vector in it can be expressed as linear combination of all the vectors in $S$. Affine Hull: The set of all affine combinations of finitely many members of a nonempty subset $S$ of a linear space $X$ is called the affine hull of $S$ (in $X$), and is denoted by $aff(S)$. That is, for any $∅ \\neq S ⊆ X$,$$aff(S):=\\left\\{\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in T}λ(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{x}:T ∈\\mathcal{P}(S)\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ λ∈\\mathbb{R}^T\\ \\ \\mbox{with} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in T}λ(\\mathbf{x})=1\\right\\}$$ where $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the class of all nonempty finite subsets of $S$. By convention, we let $aff(∅) = \\{\\mathbf{0} \\}$. By Proposition 1, $aff(S)$ is an affine manifold of $X$. Moreover, again by Proposition 1 and the Principle of Mathematical Induction, any affine manifold of $X$ that contains $S$ also contains $aff (S)$. Therefore, $aff (S)$ is the smallest affine manifold of $X$ that contains $S$. Equivalently, this manifold equals the intersection of all affine manifolds of $X$ that contain $S$. These observations help clarify the nature of the tight connection between the notions of span and affine hull of a set. Put precisely, for any nonempty subset $S$ of a linear space $X$, we have$$aff(S)=span(S−x)+x \\mbox{ for any }x∈S.$$ Linearly Dependent, Linearly Independent: Let $X$ be a linear space. A subset $S$ of $X$ is linearly dependent in $X$ if it either equals ${0}$ or at least one of the vectors in $S$ can be expressed as a linear combination of finitely many vectors in $S\\backslash\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}$. For any $m ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, any distinct vectors $\\mathbf{x}_1, …, \\mathbf{x}_m ∈ X$ are linearly dependent if $\\{\\mathbf{x}_1, …, \\mathbf{x}_m\\}$ is linearly dependent in $X$. A subset of $X$ is linearly independent in $X$ if no finite subset of it is linearly dependent in $X$. For any $m ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, the vectors $\\mathbf{x}_1, …, \\mathbf{x}_m ∈ X$ are called linearly independent if $\\{\\mathbf{x}_1, …, \\mathbf{x}_m\\}$ is linearly independent in $X$. It follows from these definitions that any set $S$ in a linear space $X$ with $\\mathbf{0} ∈ S$ is linearly dependent in $X$. For any distinct $x, y ∈ X\\backslash\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$, the set $\\{x, y\\}$ is linearly dependent in $X$ iff $y ∈ span(\\{x\\})$ iff $span(\\{x\\}) = span(\\{y\\})$. Hence, one says that two nonzero vectors $x$ and $y$ are linearly dependent iff they both lie on a line through the origin. More generally, a subset $S$ of $X\\backslash\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$ is linearly dependent in $X$ iff there exists an $x ∈ S$ such that $x ∈ span(S\\backslash\\{x\\})$. A fundamental principle of linear algebra is that there cannot be more than $m$ linearly independent vectors in a linear space spanned by $m$ vectors. Affinely Independent, Affinely Dependent: Let $X$ be a linear space. A finite subset $T$ of $X$ is affinely independent in $X$ if $\\{\\mathbf{z} − \\mathbf{x} : \\mathbf{z} ∈ T\\backslash\\{\\mathbf{x}\\}\\}$ is linearly independent in $X$ for any $\\mathbf{x} ∈ T$. An arbitrary nonempty subset $S$ of $X$ is affinely independent in $X$ if every finite subset of $S$ is affinely independent in $X$. $S$ is affinely dependent in $X$ if it is not affinely independent in $X$. Since, at most $n$ vectors can be linearly independent in $\\mathbb{R}^n, n = 1, 2, …$, it follows that there can be at most $n + 1$ affinely independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Basis: A basis for a linear space $X$ is a $⊇$-minimal subset of $X$ that spans $X$. That is, $S$ is a **basis **for $X$ iff, $X = span(S)$; and If $X = span(T)$, then $T ⊂ S$ is false. If a linear space $X$ has a finite basis, then it is said to be finite dimensional, and its dimension, $dim(X)$, is defined as the cardinality of any one of its bases. If $X$ does not have a finite basis, then it is called infinite dimensional, in which case we write $dim(X) = ∞$. Propositions and TheoremsProposition 1: Let $X$ be a linear space and $∅ \\neq S ⊆ X$. Then $S$ is an affine manifold of $X $ if, and only if, $$λx+(1−λ)y∈S\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for any}\\ \\ \\ x,y∈S\\ \\ \\mbox{and} \\ \\ \\ λ∈\\mathbb{R}.$$ Proposition 2: Let $X$ be a linear space, and $A,B ⊆ X$. If $B$ is linearly independent in $X$ and $B ⊆ span(A)$, then $|B| ≤ |A|$. Proposition 3: A subset $S$ of a linear space $X$ is a basis for $X$ if, and only if, $S$ is linearly independent and $X = span(S)$. Corollary 1: Any two bases of a finite dimensional linear space have the same number of elements. Remark 1: The dimension of an affine manifold $S$ in a linear space $X$, denoted by $dim(S)$, is defined as the dimension of the linear subspace of $X$ that is “parallel” to $S$. Put more precisely, $$dim(S) := dim(S − x)$$ for any $x ∈ S$. Corollary 2: Let $S$ be a basis for a linear space $X$. Any nonzero vector $x ∈ X$ can be expressed as a linear combination of finitely many members of $S$ with nonzero coefficients in only one way. If $X$ is finite dimensional, then every vector in $X$ can be uniquely written as a linear combination of all vectors in $S$. Theorem 1: Every linear space has a basis. Examples and ExercisesExamples: $(\\mathbb{Z},+), (\\mathbb{Q} ,+), (\\mathbb{R} ,+), (\\mathbb{R}^n,+)$ and $(\\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\},\\cdot)$ are Abelian groups where $+$ and $ \\cdot$ are the usual addition and multiplication operations. In the $(\\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\},\\cdot)$ number $1$ plays the role of the identity element. $(\\mathbb{R} , \\cdot)$ is not a group because it does not have inverse elements. Similarly, $(\\mathbb{Z} , \\cdot)$ and $(\\mathbb{Q} , \\cdot)$ are not groups. Examples: $\\mathbb{R}^n_{++}$ is not a linear space since it does not contain the origin. This is of course not the only problem. After all, $\\mathbb{R}^n_+$ is not a linear space either (under the usual operations), for it does not contain the inverse of any nonzero vector. The real sequence space $\\mathbb{R}^∞$ (which is none other than $\\mathbb{R}^\\mathbb{N} $) and the function spaces $\\mathbb{R}^T$ and $\\mathbf{B}(T)$ (for any nonempty set $T$) are linear spaces under usual operations. $\\ell^p$ (for any $1 ≤ p ≤ ∞$), along with the function spaces $\\mathbf{CB}(T )$ and $\\mathbf{C}(T )$ (for any metric space $T$), are linear spaces under usual operations. The same goes as well for other function spaces, such as $\\mathbf{P}(T )$ or the space of all polynomials on $T$ of degree $m ∈ \\mathbb{Z}_+$ (for any nonempty subset $T$ of $\\mathbb{R} $). Since the negative of an increasing function is decreasing, the set of all increasing real functions on $\\mathbb{R} $ (or on any compact interval $[a, b]$ with $a &lt; b$) is not a linear space under the usual operations. Less trivially, the set of all monotonic self-maps on $\\mathbb{R} $ is not a linear space either. Examples: $[0,1]$ is not a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R} $ whereas $\\{x ∈ \\mathbb{R}^2 : x_1 +x_2 = 0\\}$ is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For any $n ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, $\\mathbb{R}^{n×n}$ is a linear space under the usual operations. The set of all symmetric $n × n$ matrices, that is, $\\{[a_{ij}]{n×n} : a{ij} = a_{ji}\\mbox{ for each }i,j\\}$ is a linear subspace of this space. For any $n∈\\mathbb{N} $ and linear $f:\\mathbb{R}^n →\\mathbb{R} $, $\\{x∈\\mathbb{R}^n :f(x)=0\\}$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For any $m ∈ \\mathbb{N} $, the set of constant functions on $[0, 1]$ is a proper linear subspace of the set of all polynomials on $[0, 1]$ of degree at most $m$. The latter set is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbf{P}[0, 1]$ which is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbf{C}[0, 1]$ which is itself a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbf{B}[0, 1]$. $\\mathbf{B}[0, 1]$ is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}$. $\\{x ∈ \\mathbb{R}^2 : x_1 + x_2 = 1\\}$ is not a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, since this set does not contain the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. On the other hand, geometrically speaking, this set is very “similar” to the linear subspace $\\{x ∈ \\mathbb{R}^2 : x_1 + x_2 = 0\\}$. Indeed, the latter is nothing but a parallel shift (translation) of the former set. Examples: There is no hyperplane in the trivial space $\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. Since the only proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R} $ is $\\{0\\}$, any one-point set in $\\mathbb{R} $ and $\\mathbb{R} $ itself are the only affine manifolds in $\\mathbb{R} $. So, all hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R} $ are singleton sets. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, any one-point set, any line (with no endpoints) and the entire $ \\mathbb{R}^2$ are the only affine manifolds. A hyperplane in this space is necessarily of the form $\\{x ∈ \\mathbb{R}^2 : a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 = b\\}$ for some real numbers $a_1,a_2$ with at least one of them being nonzero, and some real number $b$. All hyperplanes are of the form of (infinitely extending) planes in $\\mathbb{R}^3 $. Reference Efe A. Ok, 2005, “Real Analysis with Economic Applications”; John Boller and Paul J.

The additivity property is the heart of the measure theory, entails several other useful properties for measures. Measure, Measure Space: Let $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ be a measurable space. Any \u001b$\\sigma$-additive function \u0016$\\mu: \\Sigma\\mapsto[0,\\infty]$ is called a measure on \u0006$\\Sigma$, and in that case the ordered triplet $(X,\\Sigma \u0006, \\mu\u0016)$ is said to be a measure space. If \u0016$\\mu(X) &lt;\\infty $; then $\\mu$\u0016 is called a finite measure, and $(X,\\Sigma ,\\mu \u0016)$ is referred to as a finite measure space. If there is a countable subset $\\mathcal{T}$ of $\\Sigma$\u0006 such that $X =\\bigsqcup \\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mu\u0016(T) &lt; \\infty$ for each $T\\in \\mathcal{T }$, we say that $\\mu$\u0016 is a \u001b**$\\sigma$-finite measure**, and refer to $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu)$ as a \u001b**$\\sigma$-finite measure space**. A useful interpretation is to think of a measure on \u0006$\\Sigma$ as a function that tells us the “size” of each set in $\\Sigma$\u0006 in some geometric sense. Depending on the context, for instance, this may correspond to, say, area or volume or mass, etc., of the members of \u0006$\\Sigma$. Probability Measure, Probability Space: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu)$ be a measure space. If $\\mu\u0016(X) = 1$, then $\\mu$\u0016 is said to be a probability measure, and in this case, $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu)$ is called a probability space. Roughly speaking, a probability measure tells us the likelihood of observing any conceivable event in an experiment the outcome of which is uncertain. Borel Measure, Borel Space, Borel Probability Space: Given a metric space $X$, any measure $\\mathbf{p}$ on $\\mathcal{B}(X)$ is called a Borel measure on $X$, and in this case $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X),\\mathbf{p})$ is referred to as a Borel space. If, in addition, $\\mathbf{p}$ is a probability measure, then $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X),\\mathbf{p})$ is called a Borel probability space. We denote the set of all Borel probability measures on a metric space $X$ by \u0001$\\Delta(X)$. Regular: Let $X$ be a metric space and $\\mathbf{p}\\in\\Delta(X)$. Let $\\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\\mathcal{C}_X$ denote the class of all open and closed subsets of $X$, respectively. A Borel measure $\\mathbf{p}$ on a metric space $X$ is said to be regular if$$\\inf{\\mathbf{p}(O): S\\subseteq O\\in \\mathcal{O}_X}=\\mathbf{p}(S) = \\sup \\mathbf{p}(C) : {S\\supseteq C\\in \\mathcal{C}_X}$$ holds for any $S\\in \\mathcal{B}(X)$. Much of the diffculty with working with probability measures stems from the fact that the contents of the \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra of a probability space are often obscure. The situation reads markedly better in the case of Borel probability spaces, for the $\\sigma$\u001b-algebra of such a space is generated by sets that are somewhat concrete (such as open (or closed) subsets of the sample space). Moreover, in the context of any Borel probability space, it is possible to approximate the probability of any event by using only the open and closed sets. Put more formally, if $X$ is a metric space and $\\mathbf{p}\\in\\Delta(X)$, then, for any Borel subset $S$ of $X$ and $\\varepsilon&gt; 0$, we can find an open subset $O$ and a closed subset $C$ of $X$ such that $C\\subseteq S\\subseteq\u0012 O$ and $\\mathbf{p}(O\\setminus C) &lt;\\varepsilon$. Every Borel probability measure is regular. Every finite Borel measure on a metric space is regular. Tight: A finite Borel measure $\\mathbf{p}$ on a metric space $X$ is said to be tight if for each $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is a compact subset $K$ of $X$ such that $p(X\\backslash K) &lt;\\varepsilon$. Every Borel probability measure on a complete and separable metric space is tight. Propositions and TheoremsLemma 2.1: Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a semialgebra on a nonempty set $X$, and $\\mathbf{q} : \\mathcal{S}\\mapsto [0,+\\infty]$ a finitely additive map. Then, there is a unique finitely additive map $\\mathbf{p} : \\alpha(\\mathcal{S})\\mapsto[0,+\\infty]$ such that $\\mathbf{p}(S) = \\mathbf{q}(S)$ for each $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Lemma 2.2: Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a semialgebra on a nonempty set $X$, and $\\mathbf{q}: \\mathcal{S} \\mapsto [0,+\\infty]$ a \u001b$\\sigma$-additive map. Then, there is a unique \u001b$\\sigma$-additive map $\\mathcal{p}:\\sigma(\\mathcal{S})\\mapsto [0,+\\infty]$ such that $\\mathbf{p}(S) = \\mathbf{q}(S)$ for each $S\\in \\mathcal{S}$. Every finitely additive (finitely additive and \u001b$\\sigma$-subadditive) $[0,\\infty]$-valued map on a semialgebra $\\mathcal{S}$ can be extended, uniquely, to a finitely additive (\u001b$\\sigma$-additive) $[0,\\infty]$-valued map on the algebra generated by $\\mathcal{S}$. Lemma 2.3: Let $X$ be a nonempty set, $\\mathcal{A}$ an algebra on $X$, and \u0016$\\mu:\\mathcal{A}\\mapsto[0,\\infty]$ a $\\sigma$\u001b-additive map on $\\mathcal{A}$. Then, \u0016$\\mu$ is finitely additive. Consequently, $$\\mu(B\\backslash A)=\\mu(B)-\\mu(A)\\mbox{ for any} A,B\\in \\mathcal{A}\\ \\mbox{with}\\ A\\subseteq B,$$ which shows that $\\mu$ is $\\supseteq$\u0013-increasing (that is, $\\mu\u0016(A)\\leq\\mu(B)$ for any $A,B\\in \\mathcal{A}$ with $A\\subseteq B$). Moreover,$$\\mu(\\bigcup\\mathcal{S})\\leq\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\mu(S)$$ for any countable $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$ with $\\bigcup\\mathcal{S}\\in\\mathcal{A}$. Boole’s Inequality: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$ be a probability space. Then, $$\\mathbf{p}(\\bigcup\\mathcal{S})\\leq\\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\mathbf{p}(S)\\ \\mbox{for any nonempty countable}\\ \\mathcal{S}\\subseteq\\Sigma$$ Proposition 2.4: Let $(X,\\Sigma\u0006, \\mu\u0016)$ be a finite measure space, and let $(A_m)\\in\\Sigma^\\infty$. If $A_1\\subseteq A_2\\subseteq\\cdots$ \u0012\u0001\u0001 (in which case we say that $(A_m)$ is an increasing sequence), then $$\\lim\\mu(A_m)=\\mu\\left(\\bigcup^\\infty_{i=1}A_i\\right).$$ On the other hand, if $A_1\\supseteq A_2\\supseteq \\cdots$ \u0013\u0001 (in which case we say that $(A_m)$ is a decreasing sequence), then$$\\lim\\mu(A_m)=\\mu \\left(\\bigcap^\\infty_{i=1}A_i\\right) .$$ These two properties of a finite measure measure are often referred to as the properties of continuity (from below and above, resp.) of a finite measure. Proposition 2.5: Let $X$ be a nonempty set, $\\mathcal{A}$ be an algebra on $X$, and \u0016 $\\mu:A\\rightarrow [0,\\infty]$ a finitely additive function such that \u0016$\\mu(C_m)\\downarrow 0$ for any $(C_m)\\in A^\\infty$ with $C_m\\downarrow\\empty$.

Every Borel probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}$ induces a distribution function in a natural manner. Indeed, it is easy to see that the map $t \\mapsto\\mathbf{p}(-\\infty, t]$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is a distribution function for any $\\mathbf{p}\\in \\Delta\u0001(\\mathbb{R})$ Distribution function induced by $\\mathbf{p}$: For any $\\mathbf{p}\\in \\Delta\u0001(\\mathbb{R})$, the map $F_\\mathbf{p} :\\mathbb{R}\\to [0, 1]$ defined by $F (t) := \\mathbf{p}(-\\infty, t]$, is a distribution function.

Lebesgue-Stieltjes Probability Measure induced by $F$ on $\\mathbb{R} $: Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the semialgebra of all right-semiclosed intervals. Taking any distribution function $F$, define the map $\\mathbf{q}\\in[0, 1]^{\\mathcal {S}}$ as $$\\mathbf{q}(a,b]:=F(b)-F(a).\\ \\ \\ -\\infty\\leq a\\leq b&lt;\\infty$$ and$$\\mathbf{q}(a,\\infty):=1-F(a),\\ \\ \\ \\ -\\infty\\leq a.$$ The probability measure on $\\sigma\u001b(\\mathcal{S})=\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R} )$ which accords with $\\mathbf{q}$, and denoted by $\\mathbf{p}_F$ is called the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by $F$ on $\\mathbb{R} $. Carathéodory’s Extension Theorem would then say that there is a unique extension of $\\mathbf{q}$ to a probability measure on $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R} )$. To prove $\\mathbf{q}$ is \u001b$\\sigma$-additive on $\\mathcal{S}$, let us take any countably infinite set $\\mathcal{T}$ of pairwise disjoint right-semiclosed intervals, and assume that $\\bigsqcup{T}$ is itself a right-semiclosed interval, say, $(a,b]$. As things are trivial when $a = b$, we assume in what follows that $a &lt; b$ We will assume here that $\\bigsqcup \\mathcal{T}$ is bounded from above, that is, it is an interval of the form $(a,b]$, where $-\\infty\\leq a &lt; b &lt;\\infty$ Let us then enumerate $T$ as ${f(a_1, b_1], (a_2, b_2],\\cdots}$. Then we can show that$$\\mathbf{q}(a,b]=\\sum^\\infty_{i=1}\\mathbf{q}(a_i,b_i].$$ A Borel probability measure on $\\mathbb{R} $ can actually be identified with a distribution function. Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by $F$ on $(a, b]$ / Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by $F$ on $(a, b]$: If $X := (a, b]$ with $-\\infty&lt; a &lt; b &lt; \\infty$, and $F \\in [0,1]^X$ is an increasing and right-continuous function with $F(a+) = 0$ and $F(b) = 1$, then we can define the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by $F$ on $(a, b] $, analogously. Drop the conditions $F(a+) = 0$ and $F(b) = 1$, and allow $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^X$ then we can define the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by $F$ on $(a, b] $, analogously. Lebesque Measure on $\\mathbb{R} $: Take any integer $i$, let $X_i := (i,i+1]$, and define $F_i : X_i \\rightarrow [0,1]$ by $F_i(t) := t-i$. Let $\\ell_i$ denote the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by $F_i$ on $X_i$ for each $i$ We define the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R} $ as the $[0,\\infty]$-valued map $\\ell$ on $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R} )$ with$$\\ell(S):=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathbb{Z}}\\ell_i(S\\cap X_i)$$ As such, $\\ell$ is both regular and tight. Furthermore, it assigns to any interval its length as its measure. In particular, it is readily verified that $\\ell(a, b] = b$ a for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a &lt; b$, while $\\ell(I) = \\infty$ for any unbounded interval $I$ Lebesque Measure on $\\mathbb{R} $ is, geometrically speaking, the natural measure on the real line. This is indeed a \u001b$\\sigma$-finite measure on $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R} )$. The restriction of $\\ell$ to any Borel subset $X$ of $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel measure on $X$; that is, $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X),\\ell|_{\\mathcal{B}(X)})$ is a Borel measure space for any $X\\in\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R} )$. For brevity, we denote this measure space simply as $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X),\\ell)$ in what follows. For instance, $([0,1],\\mathcal{B}([0,1]),\\ell)$ is a Borel probability space. Propositions and TheoremsCarathéodory’s Extension Theorem: Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a semialgebra on a nonempty set $X$ and take any $\\mathbf{q}: \\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow [0,\\infty]$. If $\\mathbf{q}$ is $\\sigma$\u001b-additive, then there exists a measure $\\mathbf{p}$ on \u001b$\\sigma(\\mathcal{S})$ such that $\\mathbf{p}(S) = \\mathbf{q}(S)$ for each $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Moreover, if $\\mathbf{q}(X) &lt; \\infty$, then $\\mathbf{p}$ is unique. We can always extend a $\\sigma$\u001b-additive $[0,\\infty]$-valued map on an algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ to a $\\sigma$\u001b-additive $[0,\\infty]$-valued map on $\\sigma\u001b(\\mathcal{A})$ Moreover, this extension is unique, provided that our map is real-valued. We can always obtain a probability measure, uniquely, on a \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra by specifying the behavior of the measure only on a semialgebra that generates this \u001b$\\sigma$-algebra. Since semialgebras and algebras are often easier than \u001b$\\sigma$-algebras to work with, this fact is quite useful in constructing probability measures. Proposition 3.1: For any real number a and Borel subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R} $, the set $S + a$ is Borel, and $\\ell (S + a) =\\ell (S)$. Proposition 3.4: Let $f$ be an additive self-map on $\\mathbb{R} $. If $f$ is bounded on some Borel subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R} $ with $\\ell(S) &gt; 0$, then it is linear. Examples and ExercisesExample: Any singleton set in $\\mathbb{R}$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Since the Lebesgue measure of any singleton is zero, so must be the Lebesgue measure of any countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, because the \u001b$\\sigma$-additivity of $\\ell$ implies that $\\ell{a_1, a_2\\dots, } = \\sum^\\infty \\ell{a_i}=0$ for any real sequence $(a_m)$. For instance: $\\ell(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ Example 3.5: There are in fact uncountable sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ which have Lebesgue measure zero. For example, the Contor Set. Reference Efe A.

Linearity of $\\mathbb{E}$:$$\\mathbb{E}(x+y)=\\mathbb{E}(x)+\\mathbb{E}(y)$$Monotonicity of $\\mathbb{E}$:$$\\mathbb{E}(x) \\geq \\mathbb{E}(y)\\mbox{ whenever }x\\geq_{a.s.}y$$ $$\\mathbb{E}(x)= \\mathbb{E}(y)\\mbox{ whenever }x=_{a.s.}y$$ Variance of Simple Random Variables: The variance of a simple random variable $x$ on $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$ is the number$$\\mathbb{V}(x) := \\mathbb{E}((x - \\mathbb{E}(x))^2)$$ where $(x-\\mathbb{E}(x))^2$ is the simple random variable $\\omega\\mapsto (x(\\omega) -\\mathbb{E}(x))^2$ on $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. However, it is often more convenient to use the alternate formula$$\\mathbb{V}(x) := \\mathbb{E}(x^2) - \\mathbb{E}(x)^2$$ Expectation of Nonnegative Random Variables Let $x$ be a $[0, \\infty]$-valued random variable on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$. We define the expectation of $x$ as the (extended real) number$$\\mathbb{E}(x) := \\sup{\\mathbb{E}(z) : z \\in \\mathfrak{L}(x)}$$ where $\\mathfrak{L}(x)$ stands for the set of all simple random variables $z$ such that $z\\leq x$. In turn, the variance of $x$ is defined as the (extended real) number$$\\mathbb{V}(x) := \\mathbb{E}((x - \\mathbb{E}(x))^2),$$ provided that $\\mathbb{E}(x) &lt; \\infty$. where $(x-\\mathbb{E}(x))^2$ is the simple random variable $\\omega\\mapsto (x(\\omega) -\\mathbb{E}(x))^2$ on $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. These definitions agree with those in the case of simple random variables on $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. Moreover, they extend those definitions to the case of $[0,\\infty]$-valued simple random variables. In words, the (extended real) number $\\mathbb{E}(x)$ is defined as the supremum of the weighted averages of all those simple random variables that are “smaller than” $x$ everywhere. So, in this sense, the idea behind the definition of $\\mathbb{E}(x)$ is reminiscent of that of the computation of the area under a given curve in $\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{R}_+$ by approximating this area with the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie under the curve and above the horizontal axis. Put this way, you should see that $\\mathbb{E}(x)$ can be thought of as some sort of an integral of $x$ – it is called the Lebesgue integral of $x$ with respect to $\\mathbf{p}$ –where the sets in the domain of $x$ (analogous to the bases of the rectangles under the curve) are “measured” according to the underlying probability measure. The commonly used notation for the Lebesgue integral of $x$ on $X$ with respect to $\\mathbf{p}$ is $\\int_Xxdp$, that is$$\\int_X xd\\mathbf{p}\\ \\mbox{ and }\\ \\mathbb{E}(x)$$denote the same (extended real) number. Adopting the widely used conventions of integration theory, we also set$$\\int_Sxd\\mathbf{p}:=\\mathbb{E}(x\\mathbf{1}_S)\\mbox{ for any } S\\in \\Sigma,$$where $\\mathbf{1}_S$ is the indicator function of $S$ on $X$. Therefore, recalling the definition of the expectation of a simple random variable, we see that $\\int_S d\\mathbf{p}$, that is, the Lebesgue integral of the constant function $1$ with respect to $\\mathbf{p}$ on $S$, and $\\mathbb{E}(\\mathbf{1}_S )$ denote the same number, namely, $\\mathbf{p}(S)$, for any $S\\in\\Sigma$. Many authors write$$\\int_X x(\\omega)\\mathbf{p}(dw)$$instead of $\\int_Xxd\\mathbf{p}$. The Lebesgue integral of the map $\\omega\\mapsto\\omega^2$ on the probability space $([0,1],\\mathcal{B}[0,1],\\ell)$ is, for instance, written as $\\int_{[0,1]}\\omega^2\\ell(d\\omega)$. Lebesgue Integration of Simple Maps: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu \u0016)$ be a measure space. By a nonnegative simple $\\Sigma\u0006$-measurable map on $X$, we mean a real function $f\\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X\u0006,\\Sigma)$ such that $f\\geq0$ and $f(X)$ is finite. The Lebesgue integral of any such map with respect to $\\mu$\u0016 is defined as the number$$\\int_Xfd\\mu:=\\sum_{a\\in f(X)}a\\mu{f=a},$$ where we adopt the convention that $0\\cdot\\infty$ equals $0$. Lebesgue Integration of Nonnegative Maps: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu\u0016)$ be a measure space. The Lebesgue integral of any \u0006$\\Sigma$-measurable $f : X \\to [0, \\infty]$ with respect to \u0016$\\mu$ is defined as the (extended) real number$$\\int_X fd\\mu:=\\sup{\\int_Xhd\\mu:h\\in\\mathfrak{M}(f)}$$ where $\\mathfrak{M}(f)$ stands for the set of all nonnegative simple \u0006$\\Sigma$-measurable maps $h$ on $X$ with $h\\leq f$. In turn, we define$$\\int_S fd\\mu:=\\int_X f\\mathbf{1}_S d\\mu\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ for any }S\\in\\Sigma$$ where $\\mathbf{1}_S$ is the indicator function of $S$ on $X$. $\\sigma$-finite Measure: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu\u0016)$ be a measure space. We say that this space (or \u0016$\\mu$ itself) is $\\sigma\u001b$-finite if there is a countable partition $\\mathcal{S}$ of $X$ such that $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq \\Sigma$ and \u0016$\\mu(S) &lt; \\infty$ for each $S \\in\\mathcal{S}$ Absolutely Continuous, Density Function, Density: Let $F$ be a distribution function. We say that $F$ is absolutely continuous (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) if there is a Borel measurable map $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}+$ such that$$F(t)=\\int{(-\\infty,t]}fd\\ell$$ for every real number $t$. When this is the case, we say that $F$ is induced by the density function $f$, and refer to $f$ as a density for $F$. When $f$ is a density for $F$, $F(t)-F(s)=\\int_{(s,t]}fd\\ell$ for any real numbers $s$ and $t$ with $t &gt; s$. Some distribution functions do not have closed form decriptions, but they are rather defined through integrating a density function. The most important example of such a function is the so-called normal distribution function (with parameters \u0016$\\mu $ and \u001b$\\sigma$). For any given real numbers $\\mu$ and $\\sigma&gt;0$, this function $F$ is defined by$$f(t)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{\\frac{(t-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$$for any real number $t$, it is thus trivially absolutely continuous. If \u0016 $\\mu= 0$ and \u001b$\\mu = 1$ here, this function is called the standard normal distribution function. Not all distribution function arises from a density funtion. Absolutely Continuous Measures: Let $(X,\\Sigma)$ be a measurable space, and \u0016$\\mu$ and $\\nu$\u0017 two measures on $\\Sigma$\u0006. We say that \u0016$\\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to \u0017$\\nu$, this is denoted by writing \u0016 \u001c \u0017 $\\mu\\ll\\nu$ if $\u0016\\mu(S) = 0$ for every $S\\in\\Sigma$ \u0006 with $\\nu\u0017(S) = 0$. The zero measure on $\\Sigma$\u0006 is absolutely continuous with respect to any measure on \u0006$\\Sigma$ While the counting measure on $\\Sigma$\u0006 is not absolutely continuous with respect to any measure \u0017$\\nu$ on $\\Sigma$ \u0006 such that \u0017$\\nu(S) = 0$ for some nonempty $S\\in\\Sigma$ . Propositions and TheoremsProposition 1.1: For any $[0,\\infty]$-valued random variables $x$ and $y$ (on a given probability space),$$x\\geq_{a.s.}y\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ implies }\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathbb{E}(x) \\geq \\mathbb{E}(y)$$ $$x=_{a.s.}y\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ implies }\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathbb{E}(x) = \\mathbb{E}(y)$$ The Monotone Convergence Theorem 1: Let $x, x_1,x_2,\\dots$ be $[0,\\infty]$-valued random variables on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. Then,$$x_m \\uparrow_{a.s.} x\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ implies }\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathbb{E}(x_m)\\uparrow \\mathbb{E}(x)$$ Proposition 1.2: Let $x$ and $y$ be two $[0,\\infty]$-valued random variables on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. Then, for any $a\\geq 0$,$$\\mathbb{E}(ax+y)=a\\mathbb{E}(x)+\\mathbb{E}(y)$$ Proposition 1.3: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu \u0016)$ be a finite measure space. Then, there is a real number \u0015 $\\lambda\\geq\u0015 0$ and a probability measure $\\mathbf{p}$ on $\\Sigma$\u0006 such that$$\\int_Xfd\\mu=\\lambda\\int_Xfd\\mathbf{p}$$ for every \u0006$\\Sigma$-measurable $f : X \\to [0,\\infty]$. Proposition 1.5: Given any measure space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu \u0016)$,$$\\int_x(af+g)d\\mu=a\\int_Xfd\\mu+\\int_Xgd\\mu$$ for every $a\\geq0$ and $\\Sigma$-measurable $f : X \\to [0,\\infty]$. Proposition 1.6: Every absolutely continuous distribution function is uniformly continuous. If a distribution function is not continuous even at a single point, then it cannot possibly possess a density. The converse of Proposition 1.6 is false. Indeed, even a continuous distribution function need not possess a density. Proposition 1.7: Let $(X,\\Sigma,\\nu \u0017)$ be a measure space and take any $f\\in \\mathcal{L}^0_+(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$. Then, the map $\u0016\\mu:\\Sigma \\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by$$\\mu(S):=\\int_S fd\\nu,$$ is a measure on $\\Sigma$\u0006 with \u0016 $\\mu\\ll\\nu$\u001c \u0017. If $\\nu$\u0017 is $\\sigma\u001b$-finite, so is \u0016$\\mu$. The Radon-Nikodym Theorem: Let $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ be a measurable space, and $\\mu$ \u0016and $\\nu$\u0017 two \u001b$\\sigma$-finite measures on $\\Sigma$ \u0006with $\\mu\\ll\\nu$. Then, there is an $f\\in \\mathcal{L}^0_+ ( X ,\\Sigma)$ such that$$\\mu(S)=\\int_Sfd\\nu\\mbox{ for every }S\\in\\Sigma$$ Any map $f\\in\\mathcal{L}^0_+(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ such that above equation holds is commonly referred to as either the density of \u0016$\\mu$ with respect to \u0017$\\nu$ or as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\\mu$\u0016 with respect to $\\nu$. It is quite standard to denote any such map as $\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}$. Proposition 1.8: Let $F$ be a distribution function and $\\mathbf{p}_F$ the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}$ induced by $F$. Then, $F$ is absolutely continuous iff, $\\mathbf{p}_F$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\ell$. Examples and ExercisesExample 1.1, Binomial Distribution: Let $n$ be a positive integer and $p$ a number in $[0, 1]$. A ${0,\\dots, n}$-valued random variable $x$ on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$ such that$$\\mathbf{p}{x=i}=\\left(\\begin{matrix}n\\ i\\end{matrix}\\right)p^i(1-p)^{n-i},\\ \\ \\ \\ i=0,\\dots,n$$ is said to have a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ If $n = 1$ here, we say that $x$ has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$ When $n = 1$, we have $\\mathbb{E}(x) = p(1) + (1-p)(0) = p$, that is, the expected value of any random variable that has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$ is $p$. In this case, we also find that $\\mathbb{E}(x^2) = p$, so $\\mathbb{V}(x) = p -p^2$ More generally, for any random variable that has a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$, we have$$\\mathbb{E}(x)=\\sum^n_{i=0}\\left(\\begin{matrix}n\\ i \\end{matrix}\\right)p^i(1-p)^{n-i}i=np\\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\\left(\\begin{matrix}n-1\\ i \\end{matrix}\\right)p^i(1-p)^{(n-1)-i}$$ so, by the Binomial Theorem, $\\mathbb{E}(x) = np(p + (1 -p))^{n-1} = np$. By using a similar method, we can also show that $\\mathbb{E}(x^2) = n^2 p^2 -np^2 + np$, so $\\mathbb{V}(x) = np(1-p)$. Example 1.3: Let $(X,2^X,\\mathbf{p})$ be a probability space with $X$ being a countable set. We wish to find an expression for the expectation of an arbitrary nonnegative random variable $x$ on $(X,2^X,\\mathbf{p})$. Assume that $X$ is countably infinite, and enumerate it as $X := {\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\dots}$. For every p\u001aositive integer $m$, let us define the simple random variable$$x_m(\\omega)=\\left{\\begin{matrix}x(\\omega),&amp;\\mbox{ if }\\omega\\in{\\omega_1,\\dots,\\omega_m}\\0,&amp;\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{matrix}\\right.$$ By definition of $\\mathbb{E}$ for simple random variables, we have $\\mathbb{E}(x_m) =\\sum_{i\\in[m]} x(\\omega_i)\\mathbf{p}{\\omega_i}$ for each $m$. But, $x_m \\uparrow x$, so we have $\\mathbb{E}(x_m)\\uparrow \\mathbb{E}(x)$ by the Monotone Convergence Theorem 1. Consequently,$$\\mathbb{E}(x)=\\lim\\mathbb{E}(x_m)=\\lim\\sum_{i\\in[m]}x(\\omega_i)\\mathbf{p}{\\omega_i}=\\sum^\\infty_{i=1}x(\\omega_i)\\mathbf{p}{\\omega_i}=\\sum_{x\\in X}x(\\omega)\\mathbf{p}{\\omega}$$ for any nonnegative random variable $x$ on $(X,2^X,\\mathbf{p})$. Example 1.5: For any real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a &lt; b$, the uniform distribution $F$ on $[a,b]$ is absolutely continuous. The map $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}+$ where$$f(t)=\\left{\\begin{matrix}\\frac{1}{a-b},&amp;0\\leq t\\leq b\\0,&amp;\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{matrix}\\right.$$ is a density for that distribution function. Similarly, for any $\\lambda\u0015 &gt; 0$, the exponential distribution with parameter \u0015$\\lambda$ ,is absolutely continuous. The map $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}+$ where$$f(t)=\\left{\\begin{matrix}\\lambda e^{-\\lambda t},&amp; t\\geq 0\\0,&amp;\\mbox{otherwise}\\end{matrix}\\right.$$ is a density for that distribution function.

To deal with such situations we may want to transform the given probability space (that models the underlying experiment) into another probability space the sample space of which contains the set of all values of the characteristic that we are interested in. This is achieved by means of a measurable function, which is more commonly referred to as a random variable in probability theory. In the most general sense of the term, such a function maps one measurable space into another. However, most measurable functions that are encountered in practice map a measurable space into a metric space, leading to the notion of Borel measurability. DefinitionsMeasurable: Let $(X_1,\\Sigma_1)$ and $(X_2,\\Sigma_2)$ be two measurable spaces. We say that a function $f : X_1\\rightarrow X _2$ is \u0006**$\\Sigma_1\\backslash\\Sigma_2$-measurable** if $f^{-1}(S) \\in \u0006\\Sigma_1$ for every $S \\in \\Sigma_2 $. Random Variable, \u0006$\\Sigma$-Measurable Real Function, Borel Measurable: Let $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ be a measurable space and $Y$ a metric space. A function $x : X\\rightarrow Y$ is called a $Y$-valued random variable on $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ if it is $\u0006\\Sigma\\backslash \\mathcal{B}(Y)$-measurable, that is, if $x^{-1}(S)\\in\\Sigma$ \u0006 for every $S\\in \\mathcal{B}(Y )$. An $\\mathbb{R} $-valued random variable is simply called a random variable on $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$. The set of all random variables on a measurable space $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ is denoted by $\\mathcal {L}^0(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$. Moreover, we define$$L^0_+(X,\\Sigma) := {x \\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma) : x\\geq 0}.$$ In real analysis what we call here a random variable on $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ is called a \u0006$\\Sigma$-measurable real function on $X$. Furthermore, a ($Y$-valued) random variable on a Borel probability space is said to be Borel measurable. Let $(X,\\Sigma)$ be a measurable space and $Y$ a metric space. In principle, to verify that a map $x:X\\to Y$ is a $Y$-valued random variable, we need to show that $x^{-1}(B)\\in\\Sigma$ for every Borel subset $B$ of $Y$ . Fortunately, there is a nice short-cut. If we can find a collection $\\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $Y$ that generates $\\mathcal{B}(Y)$ and if we manage to verify that $x^{-1}(\\mathcal{A})$ \u0006 for every $A\\in\\mathcal{A}$ we may then conclude that $x$ is a $Y$-valued random variable. For instance, if$$x^{-1}(O)\\in\\Sigma\\mbox{ for every open subset }O \\mbox{ of }Y,$$or$$x^{-1}(C)\\in\\Sigma\\mbox{ for every closed subset }C \\mbox{ of }Y,$$then $x$ is sure to be a $Y$-valued random variable. The fact that the set of all intervals of the form $(-\\infty,a]$, or of the form $(1,a)$, generates $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ is used frequently, so it is probably a good idea to state it separately. Given any measurable space $(X,\\Sigma)$ and a map $x : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $, we have$$x\\in\\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma)\\mbox{ iff }{\\omega\\in X:x(\\omega)\\leq a}\\in\\Sigma\\ \\mbox{ for every } a\\in\\mathbb{R}$$ and$$x\\in\\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma)\\mbox{ iff }{\\omega\\in X:x(\\omega)&lt; a}\\in\\Sigma\\ \\mbox{ for every } a\\in\\mathbb{R}$$ In measure theory and probability, we simply write ${x \\leq a}$ for the set ${ \\omega\\in X : x(\\omega) \\leq\u0014 a}$. While it may take a bit getting used to at first, this type of shorthand notation simplifies complex expressions considerably. For instance, with this notational convention, they we have$$x\\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma)\\mbox{ iff }{x\\leq a}\\in\\Sigma\\ \\mbox{ for every } a\\in\\mathbb{R}$$In what follows, we will work with these sorts of expressions routinely. All you need to do is to remember that, given a probability (or measure) space $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$, the set$${\\mbox{a statement about random variables defined on this space}}$$equals, by convention,$${\\omega\\in X :\\mbox{ this statement is true}}$$For any $x,y \\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X \u0006)$, the event that the absolute value of the difference between $x$ and $y$ is strictly larger than $3$ is written as ${|x-y|&gt; 3} $ instead of the mouthful ${\\omega\\in X : |x(\\omega) -y(\\omega)| &gt; 3}$. In turn, the probability of this event is written simply as $\\mathbf{p}{|x- y| &gt; 3}$: Random $n$-vector, Random Real Sequence, Random Bounded Map, Random Element: An $\\mathbb{R}^n$-valued random variable as a random $n$-vector if $n \\geq 2$. Analogously, an $\\mathbb{R}^{\\infty}$-valued random variable may be called a random real sequence A $\\mathbf{B}[0,1]$-valued random variable is a random bounded map on $[0,1]$ and so on. More generally, a $Y$-valued random variable (for any metric space $Y$) is sometimes referred to as a random element of $Y$. Simple: Let $Y$ be a metric space. A $Y$-valued random variable $x$ is called simple if it takes finitely many values, that is, when the range of $x$ is a finite set. Postive Parts, Negative Parts: Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $x$ an $\\overline{\\mathbb{R} }$-valued function on $X$: We define the positive and negative parts of $x$ as $$x^+:= \\max {x, 0}\\mbox{ and }x^-:= \\max {-x,0}$$ respectively. Clearly, both $x^+$ and $x^-$ are $[0, \\infty]$-valued functions on $X$, and we have$$x=x^+ -x^-$$ The absolute value of $x$ is also decomposed into these two functions as follows:$$|x|=x^+ +x^-$$ It is plain that the positive and negative parts of an $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$-valued function inherits the measurability of that function. In other words, if $x$ is an $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$-valued random variable on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$, then both $x^+$ and $x^-$ are $[0,\\infty]$-valued random variables on $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. Conversely, if $x^+$ and $x^-$ are $[0,\\infty]$-valued random variables on $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$, then $x$ must itself be an $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$-valued random variable on $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$. Propositions and TheoremsProposition 1.1: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two metric spaces, and $x: X \\rightarrow Y$ a map that is continuous at all but countably many points. Then, $x$ is a $Y $-valued random variable on $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X))$. Continuity at everywhere but countably many points is suffcient for Borel measurability. The converse is false. Even a map that is discontinuous everywhere may be Borel measurable. Proposition 1.2: Let $(X_i,\\Sigma_ i)$ be a measurable space for each $i \\in [3]$. If $f : X_1 \\rightarrow X_2$ is a \u0006$\\Sigma_1\\backslash\\Sigma_2$-measurable map and $g : X_2 \\rightarrow X_3$ is a \u0006$\\Sigma_2\\backslash\\Sigma_3$-measurable map, then $g \u000e\\circ f$ is a \u0006$\\Sigma_1\\backslash\\Sigma_3$-measurable map from $X_1$ into $X_3$. Proposition 1.5: Let $Y$ be a metric space and $(x_m)$ a sequence of $Y $-valued random variables on a measurable space $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ such that $x_m\\rightarrow x $ for some function $x: X \\rightarrow Y$ . Then, $x$ is a $Y $-valued random variable on $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$. If $(x_m)$ is a sequence of metric space-valued random variables on some measurable space, $\\lim x_m$ is well-defined as a random variable on that space This is unlike what is the case with continuous functions. Corollary 1.6: Let $(x_m)$ be an increasing sequence of $\\overline{\\mathbb{R} }$-valued random variables on a measurable space $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$. Then, $\\lim x_m$ is an $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$-valued random variable on $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$. Theorem 1.7: Let $Y$ be a compact metric space and $x$ a $Y $-valued random variable on a measurable space $(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$. Then, there is a sequence $(x_m)$ of simple $Y$-valued random variables on $(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ such that $x_m\\rightarrow x$ uniformly. For a random variable with compact range, we can approximate a given random variable on a measurable space by means of simple random variables on that space. Examples and ExercisesExample 1.1: If $X$ is a nonempty set and $Y$ a metric space, then any map from $X$ into $Y$ is a $Y$-valued random variable on $(X,2^X )$. In particular, $\\mathbb{R}^X = \\mathcal{L}^0(X, 2^X )$. If $X$ is finite, then any such function is a simple random variable on $(X,2^X )$. Example 1.3: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two metric spaces. If $x : X\\to Y$ is continuous, then $x$ is a $Y $-valued random variable on $(X,\\mathcal{B}(X))$. Indeed, continuity of $x$ implies that the inverse image of every open set in $Y$ under $x$ is open in $X$. So this is enough to conclude that $x$ is a $Y$-valued random variable. In particular, $\\mathbf{C}(X) \\subseteq \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\mathcal{B}(X))$ Example: $x\\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ implies $ax\\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ for any real number $a$. $x + y \\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma \u0006)$ for any $x,y\\in \\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\Sigma\u0006)$ is a linear space under the usual (pointwise) addition and scalar multiplication operations. The set of all simple random variables on $(X,\\Sigma\u0006) $ constitutes a linear subspace of this linear space, which is itself a linear $X$ subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^X $ . If $X$ is a metric space, then $\\mathbf{C}(X)$ is also a linear subspace of $\\mathcal{L}^0(X,\\mathcal{B}(X))$. Reference Efe A.

Distribution Function: When $x$ is a random variable that is, $Y = \\mathbb{R} $, the distribution function induced by $\\mathbf {p}_x $is called the distribution function of $x$. We denote this distribution function by $F_x$, and say that $x$ is continuous if $F_x$ is a continuous function. On the other hand, we say that $x$ is discrete if $F_x$ is a discrete distribution function. We often describe the probabilistic behavior of a random variable by specifying its distribution function directly. So, the statement$$x \\mbox{ is a random variable on }X \\mbox{ with the distribution function }F$$means that $x$ is a random variable on some probability space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$ such that the distribution of $x$ is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by $F$, that is, $F = F_x$. For the single measure on the probability space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$, if we have different random variables, we will also have different distribution functions. Equal \u0016$\\mu$-almost everywhere, Equal almost surely: Let $Y$ be a separable metric space, and $x$ and $y$ two $Y $-valued random variables on a measure space $(X,\\Sigma\u0006,\\mu)$. If \u0016$\\mu{x\\neq y}=0$, we say that $x$ and $y$ are equal \u0016$\\mu$-almost everywhere, and write $x\u0016=_{\\mu-a.e.} y$. But if \u0016$\\mu$ is a probability measure, and $x$ and $y$ are equal \u0016$\\mu$-almost everywhere; that is, when \u0016$\\mu{x = y} = 1$, we say that $x $ and $y$ are equal almost surely (assuming that \u0016$\\mu$ is understood from the context), and write $x =_{a.s.} y$. $x$ large than $y$ $\\mu$-almost everywhere, larger than $y$ almost surely: Let $x$ and $y$ be two $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$-valued random variables on a measure space $(X,\\Sigma,\\mu\u0016)$. If \u0016${x &lt; y} = 0$, we say that $x$ is larger than $y$ \u0016$\\mu$-almost everywhere, and write $x\\geq_{\\mu\u0016-a.e.} y$. But if \u0016$\\mu$ is a probability measure, and $x$ is larger than $y$ \u0016$\\mu$-almost everywhere, that is, when \u0016${x \u0015\\geq y} = 1$, we say that $x$ is larger than $y$ almost surely (assuming that $\\mu$\u0016 is understood from the context), and write $x\\geq_{\u0015a.s.} y$. The expressions “$x\\leq_{\\mu-a.e.}y$” and “$x\\leq_{\u0014a.s.} y$” are understood similarly. Converge Almost Surely: Let $Y$ be a separable metric space, and let $x,x_1,x_2,\\cdots$ be a $Y$-valued random variables on a probability space $(X,\\Sigma, \\mathbf{p})$. We say that $(x_m)$ converges almost surely to $x$ (or that $x$ is an almost sure limit of $(x_m)$) whenever $\\mathbf{p}{x_m\\to x}=1$, that is, $$\\mathbf{p}{\\omega\\in X : d_Y (x_m(\\omega),x(\\omega)) \\to 0} = 1.$$ In this case, we write $x_m\\to_{a.s.} x$, but if $x$ is a constant map, say, $x =\\nu \u0017$ for some $\u0017\\nu\\in Y$, we abuse notation and write $x_m\\to_{a.s.}\\nu \u0017$. Examples and ExercisesUniform Distribution: Let $a $ and $b$ be two real numbers with $a &lt; b$. Consider the distribution function $F$ where $F |{(-\\infty,a)} = 0,\\ F|{(b,\\infty) }= 1$, and $$F(t)=\\frac{t-a}{b-a},\\ \\ \\ a\\leq t\\leq b.$$ This distribution function, as well as the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by it, is called the uniform distribution on $[a, b]$. In turn, a random variable with the uniform distribution on $[a,b]$ is often referred to as a “random variable which is uniformly distributed on $[a, b]$”. Exponential Distribution: Let $\\lambda$\u0015 be a positive real number. Consider the distribution function $F$ where $F|_{(-\\infty;0)} = 0$ and $$F(t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}, \\ \\ \\ \\ t\\geq0.$$ This distribution function, as well as the Lebesgue-Stieltjes probability measure induced by it, is called the exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda$\u0015. In turn, a random variable with the exponential distribution with parameter \u0015 is often referred to as a “random variable which is exponentially distributed with parameter \u0015$\\lambda$”. Remark 2.1: There is a one-to-one correspondence between any two of the following three concepts: Borel probability measures on $\\mathbb{R} $ Distribution functions Random variables on $ ((0, 1), \\mathcal{B}(0, 1),\\ell)$, (with different distributions $\\ell_x$, actually) Every random variable transfers a measure space to a Borel probability space. The measure space is the same, but different random variables transfer it into different Borel probability spaces. The Lebesgue measure on the measure space equals the probability measure on the Borel measure space. If $\\mathbf{p}$ is induced by a strictly increasing distribution function, say $F$. Since $F$ is then a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ onto $(0,1)$, it is invertible, and we may define in this case $x := F^{-1}$ Since $x$ is increasing, we have $x\\in \\mathcal{L}^0((0,1), \\mathcal{B}(0,1))$. Moreover,$$\\ell_x(a, b] = \\ell(x^{-1}(a), x^{-1}(b)] = F (b)- F (a) = \\mathbf{p}(a, b]$$for any $-\\infty \\leq\u0014 a \\leq\u0014 b &lt; 1$$$\\ell_x(a,\\infty) = 1 - F (a) = \\mathbf{p}(a,\\infty)$$for any $-\\infty\\leq \u0014 a$. Thus $\\ell_x$ and $\\mathbf{p}$ agree on the semialgebra of all right-semiclosed intervals. If $F$ is not invertible, need to define Pseudo-Inverse: Define the pseudo-inverse of a distribution function $F$ as the map $F^{-1} :(0,1)\\to \\mathbb{R} $ with$$F^{-1}(\\omega) := \\inf {t\\in \\mathbb{R} : F(t) \\geq\\omega}.$$ Example 2.3: Consider the probability space $(\\mathbb{N},2^\\mathbb{N},\\mathbf{p})$ where $\\mathbf{p}{i} = 2^{-i}$ for each $i\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Any two ($Y$-valued) random variables $x$ and $y$ on this space is almost surely equal to each other is $x = y$. Example 2.3: Consider the probability space $([0,1], \\mathcal{B}[0, 1], \\ell)$ and take any two random variables $x$ and $y$ on this space. If $x|{[0,1]\\setminus\\mathbb{Q} }= y|{[0,1]\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}}$, then $x =_{a.s.} y$. Of course, we can replace $\\mathbb{Q}$ with any countable subset of $[0, 1]$ in this observation. Example 2.4: Consider the probability space $([0,1], \\mathcal{B}[0, 1], \\ell)$. Consider the sequence $(x_m) $ in $\\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}$ where $x_m(\\omega) := 1 + \\omega^m$. Then, $x_m\\to 1$ is false, because $x_m(1) = 2$ for each $m$, and yet ${x_m\\to 1} = [0, 1)$, and hence $x_m \\to_{a.s.} 1$. Example 2.4: Consider the probability space $([0,1], \\mathcal{B}[0, 1], \\ell)$. Consider the sequence $(y_m)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}$ where $y_m$ is the indicator function of $[0, \\frac{m+1}{2m}]$ on $[0,1]$. Then, $y_m\\to_{a.s}. \\mathbf{1}_{[0,\\frac{1}{2})}$, but $y_m(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$ for each $m$. Reference Efe A.

Any one of the intervals $[a_{i-1},a_i] $ is called a subinterval of $\\mathbf{a}$, while any one of $a_i$s is called a division point of $\\mathbf{a}$. The maximum value of the lengths of its subintervals is called the mesh of $\\mathbf{a}$-this value is denoted by $\\mbox{mesh}(\\mathbf{a})$. The collection of all dissections of $[a, b]$ is denoted as $\\mathcal{D}[a, b]$.

We also have $\\mbox{mesh}(\\mathbf{b})\\leq \u0014\\mbox{mesh}(\\mathbf{a})$ if $\\mathbf{b}$ is finer than $\\mathbf{a}$, but not conversely. Darboux Sum: Take any bounded real functions $\\varphi$ and $F$ on $[a, b]$ with $F$ being increasing. For any dissection $\\mathbf{a} = [a_0,\\cdots, a_m]$ of $[a, b]$, we define $$\\check{\\varphi}{\\mathbf{a}}(i):=\\sup{\\varphi(t):a{i-1}\\leq t\\leq a_i}$$ and$$\\hat{\\varphi}{\\mathbf{a}}(i):=\\inf{\\varphi(t):a{i-1}\\leq t\\leq a_i}$$ for each $i\\in [m]$. (Since $\\varphi$ is bounded, every one of these numbers is real.) By a Darboux sum of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$ and $\\mathbf{a}$, we mean a number like$$\\sum_{i\\in[m]}\\alpha_i(F(a_i)-F(a_{i-1}))$$ where $\\hat{\\varphi}_{\\mathbf{a}} (i)\\leq \u0014\\alpha_i\u0014\\leq \\check{\\varphi}_{\\mathbf{a}}(i)$ for each $i$. In particular, the $\\mathbf{a}$-upper Darboux sum of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$ is defined as the number$$\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi):=\\sum{i\\in[m]}\\check{\\varphi}_{\\mathbf{a}}(i)(F(a_i)-F(a_{i-1}))$$ and the $\\mathbf{a}$-lower Darboux sum of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$ is defined dually as$$\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi):=\\sum{i\\in[m]}\\hat{\\varphi}_{\\mathbf{a}}(i)(F(a_i)-F(a_{i-1}))$$ Clearly, $\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)$ decreases, and $\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)$ increases, as a becomes finer. Evidently, we always have $\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)\\geq\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi) $. Furthermore, and this is important, we have$$\\inf{\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi):\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathcal{D}[a,b]}\\geq\\sup{\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi):\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathcal{D}[a,b]}$$ The number on the left-hand side of this inequality is called the upper Stieltjes integral of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$, and is denoted by $\\mathcal{S}_F (\\varphi)$. Similarly, the number on the right-hand side is called the lower Stieltjes integrals of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$, and is denoted by $\\mathbf{s}_F (\\varphi)$. Thus, our inequality reads:$$\\mathcal{S}_F (\\varphi)\\geq\\mathbf{s}_F (\\varphi)$$ Stiltjes Integrals, Stieltjes Integrable, $F$-integrable: Let $\\varphi,F\\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ and assume that $F$ is increasing. Suppose that there exists a real number $\\theta $ such that, for any $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a dissection $\\mathbf{a}$ of $[a, b]$ with $$|\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)-\\theta|&lt;\\varepsilon\\mbox{ and }|\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)-\\theta|&lt; \\varepsilon$$ Then this number \u0012$\\theta$ is unique, and it is denoted by$$\\int^b_a\\varphi dF\\mbox{ or }\\int^b_a\\varphi(t)dF(t)$$ When it exists, we refer to this number as the Stieltjes integral of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$, and in that case, we say that $\\varphi$ is Stieltjes integrable with respect to $F$, or simply, $F$-integrable. If , $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable, we also define$$\\int^a_b\\varphi dF=-\\int^b_a\\varphi dF$$ Finally, where $a\\leq c\\leq \u0014 d\\leq \u0014 b$, we say that $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on $[c,d]$, if $\\varphi|{[c,d]}$ is $F|{[c,d]}$-integrable. $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable iff the upper and lower Stieltjes integrals of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$ are equal, that is,$$\\inf{\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi) :\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathcal{D}[a, b]} = \\sup{\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi) : \\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathcal{D}[a, b]}$$ The following statements are equivalent: $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable, $\\mathbf{S}_F(\\varphi) = \\mathbf{s}_F(\\varphi)$, \u000fFor every $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is a dissection $\\mathbf{a}\\in \\mathcal{D}[a, b]$ such that$$\\mathbf{S}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi) -\\mathbf{s}{F,\\mathbf{a}}(\\varphi)&lt;\\varepsilon$$ Riemman Integrable, Riemann Intergral: The Riemann integral is a special case of the Stieltjes integral. Formally, we say that $\\varphi\\in \\mathbb{R}^{[a,b]}$ is Riemann integrable if it is $\\mbox{id}_{[a,b]}$-integrable, and for any such $\\varphi$, we define the Riemann integral of $\\varphi$, denoted by $$\\int^b_a\\varphi(t)dt$$ as the Stieltjes integral of $\\varphi$ with respect to the identity function on $[a, b]$. Continuous almost everywhere: Let us agree to call a real map $\\varphi$ on $[a,b]$ continuous almost everywhere on $[a, b]$ if $$d(\\varphi):={t\\in[a,b]:\\varphi\\mbox{ is not continuous at }t}$$ is a “small” set in the following sense: For every $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there is an open subset $O$ of $[a,b]$ such that $ d(\\varphi)\u0012\\subseteq O$ and $\\ell(O) &lt;\\varepsilon$. The totality of discontinuity points $\\varphi$ fits within an open set of arbitrarily Lebesgue measure. $F$-integrable, Improper Stieltjes Integral, Riemann Integrable: Let $\\varphi$ and $F$ be any two self-maps on $\\mathbb{R} $, and assume that $F$ is increasing. Given any real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a \\leq b$, we say that $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on $[a,b]$, if $\\varphi$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ and $\\int^b_a\\varphi dF$ exists. (Note. If $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on $[a,b]$, then $\\int^b_a\\varphi dF$ is a real number.) In turn, we say that $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on $[a,\\infty)$ if $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on $[a,b]$ for each $b\\geq a$, and $\\lim_{b\\to \\infty}\\int^b_a\\varphi dF\\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R} }$ In this case we define the (improper) Stieltjes integral of $\\varphi$ with respect to $F$ on this unbounded interval as$$\\int^\\infty_a\\varphi dF:=\\lim_{c\\to \\infty}\\int^c_a\\varphi dF.$$ The $F $-integrability of $\\varphi$ on $(-\\infty,a]$ and the extended real number $\\int^a_{-\\infty}\\varphi dF$ is analogously defined. Finally, we say that $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable, if there exists a real number a such that $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable on both $(-\\infty,a]$ and $[a,\\infty)$, and the expression $\\int^a_\\infty \\varphi dF+\\int^\\infty_a\\varphi dF$ is not of the indeterminate form $\\infty-\\infty$. In this case, we define$$\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}\\varphi dF:=\\int^a_{-\\infty}\\varphi dF+\\int^\\infty_{a}\\varphi dF,$$ and note that this definition allows $\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}\\varphi dF$ to equal $-\\infty$ or $\\infty$. If $\\varphi$ is $id_{\\mathbb{R} }$-integrable, then we say that it is Riemann integrable. The $F $-integrability of $\\varphi$ implies that, on every compact interval, $\\varphi$ is $F $-integrable. In particular, such a $\\varphi$ is bounded on every compact interval. A self-map on $\\mathbb{R} $ with this property is said to be locally bounded. Continous Almost Everywhere: The notion of almost everywhere continuity is extended to self-maps on $\\mathbb{R} $ in the obvious way. Put precisely, we say that $\\varphi$ is continuous almost everywhere (or almost everywhere continuous) if, for every $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is an open subset $O$ of $\\mathbb{R} $ such that $\\ell(O) &lt; \\varepsilon$ and every point of discontinuity of $\\varphi$ is contained in $O$. Obviously, if $\\varphi$ is continuous almost everywhere, then it is continuous almost everywhere on any compact interval. Density, Density Function: We say that a distribution function $F$ has density, if there exists an almost everywhere continuous map $f : \\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}_+$ such that $f$ is locally bounded and $$F(s)=\\int^s_{-\\infty}f(t)dt$$ for every real number $s$. In this case, we say that $f$ is a density function for $F$. Propositions and TheoremsLemma 1.1: Let $\\varphi,\\ F\\in \\mathbf{B}[a,b]$ be such that $F$ is increasing. If $\\varphi$ is $F$-integrable, then, $$\\int^b_a\\varphi dF=\\int^c_a\\varphi dF+\\int^b_c\\varphi dF,\\ \\ \\ \\ a\\leq c\\leq b$$ The same conclusion also holds if $\\varphi$ is $F $-integrable on both $[a, c]$ and $[c, b]$. The Stieltjes integral is additive with respect to the interval of integration. Lemma 1.2: Assume $a &lt; b$, and take any $\\varphi, F\\in \\mathbf{B}[a,b]$ with $F$ being increasing.

Then, for any real number $\\alpha$, we have $$\\int^b_a(\\alpha\\varphi+\\phi)dF=\\alpha\\int^b_a\\varphi dF+\\int^b_a\\phi dF$$ The Stieltjes integral is linear with respect to its integrand. Proposition 1.6: (Stieltjes) Take any $\\varphi, F\\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ with $F$ being increasing. If $\\varphi$ is continuous, then it is $F$-integrable. Proposition 1.7: Let $\\varphi, F \\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ and assume that $F$ is increasing and Lipschitz continuous. If $\\varphi$ is continuous almost everywhere on $[a,b]$, then it is $F $-integrable. The Lebesgue Criterion: If $\\varphi \\in \\mathbf{B}[a,b]$ is continuous almost everywhere on $[a,b] $, then it is Riemann integrable. Riemann integrability = Continuity almost everywhere. Corollary 1.8: Let $\\varphi\\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ be continuous almost everywhere on $[a, b]$. If $\\varphi$ vanishes almost everywhere on $[a, b]$, then $$\\int^b_a\\varphi(t)dt=0$$ The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 1: Let $f \\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ be continuous almost everywhere and $F\\in \\mathbb{R}^{[a,b]}$ satisfy $$F(s)=F(a)+\\int^s_af(r)dr,\\ \\ \\ \\ a\\leq s\\leq b$$ Then, $F$ is Lipschitz continuous on $[a,b]$, and for every $s\\in [a,b]$ at which $f$ is continuous, $F’(s)$ exists and equals $f(s)$. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 2: Take any $F\\in \\mathbf{C}^1[a,b]$, and let $f \\in \\mathbf{B}[a,b]$ is a Riemann integrable function such that $F’ = f$ almost everywhere on $[a, b]$. Then we have$$F(s)=F(a)+\\int^s_af(r)dr,\\ \\ \\ \\ a\\leq s\\leq b$$ Roughly speaking, The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that we can think of dif ferentiation and Riemann integration as inverse operations. Theorem 1.10: Let $\\varphi\\in \\mathbf{B}[a, b]$ be continuous almost everywhere on $[a, b]$. Then, for any increasing $F\\in \\mathbf{C}^1[a,b]$, we have $$\\int^b_a\\varphi dF=\\int^b_a\\varphi(t)F’(t)dt$$ Corollary 1.11: Let $f,\\varphi\\in \\mathbf{B}[a,b]$ be continuous almost everywhere on $[a,b]$ and assume $f \\geq\u0015 0$. Then, for any $F\\in \\mathbf{C}^1[a, b]$ such that$$F(s)=F(a)+\\int^s_af(r)dr,\\ \\ \\ \\ a\\leq s\\leq b$$ holds, we have $$\\int^b_a\\varphi dF=\\int^b_a\\varphi(t)f(t)dt$$ Theorem 1.10 and Corollary 1.11 help to reduce a Stieltjes Integral to a Riemann Integral, gaining computational power. Proposition 1.12: Let $\\varphi$ and $F$ be two self-maps on $\\mathbb{R} $, and assume that $F$ is increasing and continuously differentiable. If $\\varphi$ is nonnegative, locally bounded, and continuous almost everywhere, then it is $F $-integrable. Theorem 1.13: Let $F\\in \\mathbf{C}^1(\\mathbb{R} )$ be a distribution function, and $\\varphi$ a locally bounded self-map on $\\mathbb{R} $ that is continuous almost everywhere. If $f$ is a density function for $F $, then $$\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}\\varphi dF=\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}\\varphi(t)f(t)dt$$ in the sense that if one side exists so does the other. Reference Efe A.

Group A group is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $∗$ such that the associative law holds: for every $x, y, z ∈ G$, $x ∗ (y ∗ z) = (x ∗ y) ∗ z$ there is an element $e∈G$, called the identity, with $e∗x=x=x∗e$ for all $x∈G$ every $x∈G$ has an inverse; there is $x’∈G$ with $x∗x’=e=x’∗x$. Abelian Group A group $G$ is called abelian if it satisfies the commutative law: $x∗y=y∗x$ holds for every x, y ∈ G. We will usually denote the product $x ∗ y$ in a group by $xy$, and we will denote the identity by $1$ instead of by $e$. When a group is abelian, however, we will often use the additive notation $x + y$; in this case, we will denote the identity by $0$, and we will denote the inverse of an element $x$ by $−x$ instead of by $x^{−1}$. Ring: A ring $(R, +, ·)$ is an abelian group $(R, +)$ endowed with a second binary operation $·$, satisfying on its own the requirements of being associative and having a two-sided identity and further interacting with $+$ via the distributive properties:, i.e., $∀r,s,t∈R$, $(r·s)·t=r·(s·t)$, $∃1_R ∈ R, ∀r ∈ R$, $r · 1_R = r = 1_R · r$ $∀r,s,t∈R$, $(r+s)·t=r·s+r·t$ and $t·(r+s)=t·r+t·s$. What we are calling a ring, others may call a ring with identity or a ring with 1: it is not uncommon to exclude the axiom of existence of a multiplicative identity from the list of axioms defining a ring. Commutative Ring A commutative ring $R$ is a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, such that $R$ is an abelian group under addition; (commutativity) $ab = ba$ for all $a, b ∈ R$; (associativity) $a(bc) = (ab)c$ for every $a,b, c ∈ R$; there is an element $1∈R$ with $1a=a$ for every $a∈R$; (distributivity) $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ for every $a, b, c ∈ R$. Subring A subset S of a commutative ring R is a subring of R if $1 ∈ S$; if $a,b∈S$, then $a−b∈S$; if $a,b∈S$, then $ab∈S$. Domain / Integral Domain A domain / Integral domain is a commutative ring $R$ that satisfies two extra axioms: $1\\neq 0$; The cancellation law for multiplication: For all $a, b, c ∈ R$, if $ca = cb$ and $c\\neq 0$, then $a = b$. Divide: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of a commutative ring $R$. Then $a$ divides $b$ in $R$ (or $a$ is a divisor of $b$ or $b$ is a multiple of $a$), denoted by $a | b$, if there exists an element $c ∈ R$ with $b = ca$. Unit, Inverse: An element $u$ in a commutative ring $R$ is called a unit if $u | 1$ in $R$ that is, if there exists $v ∈ R$ with $uv = 1$; the element $v$ is called the inverse of $u$ and $v$ is often denoted by $u^{−1}$. Group of Units: If $R$ is a commutative ring, then the group of units of $R$ is $U(R) = {\\mbox{all units in }R}$. Field: A field $F$ is a commutative ring in which $1\\neq 0$ and every nonzero element $a$ is a unit; that is, there is $a^{−1} ∈ F$ with $a^{−1}a = 1$. Subfield: A subfield of a field $K$ is a subring $k$ of $K$ that is also a field. Propositions and TheoremsLemma 2.16. Let G be a group. The cancellation laws hold: If either $x∗a=x∗b$ or $a∗x=b∗x$, then $a=b$. The element $e$ is the unique element in $G$ with $e∗x=x=x∗e$ for all $x∈G$. Each $x ∈ G$ has a unique inverse: There is only one element $x’∈ G$ with $x ∗ x’ = e = x′ ∗ x$ (henceforth, this element will be denoted by $x^{−1}$). $(x^{-1})^{−1} = x$ for all $x ∈ G$. Proposition 3.2. Let $R$ be a commutative ring. $0·a=0$ for every $a∈R$. If $1 = 0,$ then $R$ consists of the single element $0$. In this case, $R$ is called the zero ring. If $−a$ is the additive inverse of $a$, then $(−1)(−a) = a$. $(−1)a = −a$ for every $a ∈ R$. If $n∈N$ and $n1=0$, then $na=0$ for all $a∈R$. Proposition 3.3. A subring $S$ of a commutative ring $R$ is itself a commutative ring. Reference John Boller and Paul J.

A random sample for $x$ is a finite collection $x_1,\\dots,x_m$ of i.i.d. random variables on $(X,\\Sigma,\\mathbf{p})$ such that $x_1 =_{a.s.} x$. A (real-valued) statistic based on such a random sample is a random variable of the form $\\varphi(x_1,\\dots, x_m)$, where $\\varphi$ is a Borel measurable real function on $\\mathbb{R}\\cup \\mathbb{R}^2\\cdots $ Notice that $\\varphi$ can accomodate any random sample regardless of its size. Unbiased estimator: The statistics based on a random sample are used to derive inferences about the characteristics of the random variable of interest. We would then surely wish them to satisfy certain properties. For instance, a desirable property in this regard is that of unbiasedness: We say that a statistic $\\varphi(x_1,\\dots,x_m)$ based on the random sample $x_1,\\dots, x_m$ is an unbiased estimator of \u0012$x$ if$$\\mathbb{E}(\\varphi(x_1,\\dots,x_m))=\\theta_x$$ where \u0012$\\theta_x$ is a characteristic of $x$, such as its mean or another moment.

The Discrete-Variable VersionSuppose that a firm engages in transforming a certain substance from an initial state $A$ (raw material state) into a termi­nal state $Z$ (finished product state) through a five-stage production process. In every stage, the firm faces the problem of choosing among several possible alternative subprocesses, each entailing a specific cost. The ques­tion is: How should the firm select the sequence of subprocesses through the five stages in order to minimize the total cost? In Fig. 1.1, our problem is transformed to choose a connected sequence of arcs going from left to right, starting at $A$ and terminating at $Z$, such that the sum of the values of the component arcs is minimized. The optimal solution for the present example is the path $ACEHJZ$, with $14 as the minimum cost of production. The Continuous-Variable VersionWe can visualize Fig. 1.2 to be a map of an open terrain, with the stage variable representing the longitude, and the state variable representing the latitude. Our assigned task is to transport a load of cargo from location $A$ to location $Z$ at minimum cost by selecting an appropriate travel path. The cost associated with each possible path de­pends, in general, not only on the distance traveled, but also on the topography on that path. Regardless of whether the variables are discrete or continuous, a simple type of dynamic optimization problem would contain the following basic ingredients: a given initial point and a given terminal point; a set of admissible paths from the initial point to the terminal point; a set of path values serving as performance indices (cost, profit, etc.) associated with the various paths; and a specified objective-either to maximize or to minimize the path value or performance index by choosing the optimal path. For most of the problems, the stage variable will represent time; then the optimal path is actually optimal time path. The Concept of a FunctionalThe relationship between paths and path values represents a special sort of mapping not a mapping from real numbers to real numbers as in the usual function but a mapping from paths (curves) to real numbers (performance indices). Let us denote time paths by $y_I(t), y_{II}(t)$, and so on. Then the mapping is as shown in Fig. 1.3, where $V_I$, $V_{II}$ represent the associated path values. The general notation for the mapping should there­ fore be $V[y(t)]$. But this symbol fundamentally differs from the composite-function symbol $g[f(x)]$. In the latter, $g$ is a function of $f$, and $f$ is in turn a function of $x$; thus, $g$ is in the final analysis a function of $x$. In the symbol $V[y(t)]$, on the other hand, the $y(t)$ component comes as an integral unit-to indicate time paths-and there­fore $V$ is actually a functional of $y(t)$ Variable Endpoints and Transversality ConditionsTypes of Variable Terminal PointsIn Fig. 1.5a, while the planning horizon is fixed at time $T$, any point on the vertical line $t = T$ is acceptable as a terminal point, such as $Z_1$, $Z_2$, and $Z_3$• This type of problem is commonly referred to in the literature as a fixed-time-horizon problem, fixed-time problem, or the vertical-terminal-line problem, meaning that the termi­nal time of the problem is fixed rather than free. In Fig. 1.5b, the horizontal line $y = Z$ constitutes the set of admissible terminal points. Each of these, depending on the path chosen, may be associated with a different terminal time, as exemplified by $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$• This type of problem is commonly referred to as a fixed-endpoint problem, or the horizontal-terminal-line problem. In the third type, neither the termi­nal time $T$ nor the terminal state $Z$ is individually preset, but the two are tied together via a constraint equation of the form $Z = \\phi(T)$, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5c. We shall call this type of problem the terminal-curve (or terminal-surface) problem . Transversality ConditionThe common feature of variable-terminal-point problems is that the planner has one more degree of freedom than in the fixed-terminal-point case. But this fact automatically implies that, in deriving the optimal solution, an extra condition is needed to pinpoint the exact path chosen. In the former, the optimal path must satisfy the boundary (initial and terminal) conditions$$y(0) =A\\mbox{ and }y(T)=Z\\ \\ \\ \\ (T,A, \\mbox{ and }Z \\mbox{ all given})$$ In the latter case, the initial condition $y(O)=A$ still applies by assumption. But since $T$ and / or $Z$ are now variable, the terminal condition $y(T) = Z$ is no longer capable of pinpointing the optimal path for us. As Fig. 1.5 shows, all admissible paths, ending at $Z_1, Z_2$, or other possible terminal positions, equally satisfy the condition $y(T) = Z$. What is needed, therefore, is a terminal condition that can conclusively distinguish the optimal path from the other admissible paths. Such a condition is referred to as a transversal­ity condition, because it normally appears as a description of how the optimal path crosses the terminal line or the terminal curve (to “transverse” means to “to go across”). The Objective FunctionalThe Integral Form of FunctionalThe standard form with one state variable:$$V[y]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),y’(t)]dt$$ The standard form with two state variables:$$V[y,z]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),z(t),y’(t),z’(t)]dt$$ Other Forms of FunctionalRely exclusively on the terminal point with one state variable: Problem of Mayer: $$V[y]=G[T,y(T)]$$ Rely both on path values and the terminal point: Problem of Bolza: $$V[y]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),y’(t)]dt+G[T,y(T)]$$ Although the problem of Bolza may seem to be the more general formulation, the truth is that the three types of problems-standard, Mayer, and Bolza-are all convertible into one another. Rely exclusively on the terminal point with two state variables: Problem of Mayer with two state variables $$V[y,z]=G[T, y(T),z(T)]$$ Alternative Approaches to Dynamic OptimizationThe Calculus of Variations$$\\begin{array}{lll} \\mbox{Maximize or Minimize} &amp;V[y]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),y’(t)]dt\\ \\ \\mbox{subject to}&amp; y(0)=A\\ &amp;(A\\ \\mbox{given})\\ \\ \\mbox{and }&amp;y(T)=Z\\ &amp;(T,Z\\ \\mbox{given})\\end{array}$$ In order to make such problems meaningful, it is necessary that the functional be integrable (i.e., the integral must be convergent). Furthermore, we shall assume that all the functions that appear in the problem are continuous and continuously differentiable. This assumption is needed because the basic methodology underlying the calcu­lus of variations closely parallels that of the classical differential calculus. The main difference is that, instead of dealing with the differential $dx$ that changes the value of $y=f(x)$, we will now deal with the “variation” of an entire curve $y(t)$ that affects the value of the functional $V[y]$. Optimal Control Theory$$\\begin{array}{lll} \\mbox{Maximize or Minimize} &amp;V[u]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),u(t)]dt\\ \\ \\mbox{subject to}&amp; y’(t)=f[t,y(t),u(t))]\\ \\ &amp;y(0)=A\\ &amp;(A\\ \\mbox{given})\\ \\ \\mbox{and }&amp;y(T)=Z\\ &amp;(T,Z\\ \\mbox{given})\\end{array}$$ Additional constraint:$$u(t)\\in\\mathscr{U}\\mbox{ for }0\\leq t\\leq T$$ Aside from the time variable $t$ and the state variable $y(t)$, consideration is given to a control variable $u(t)$. Indeed, it is the latter type of variable that gives optimal control theory its name and occupies the center of stage in this new approach to dynamic optimiza­tion. To focus attention on the control variable implies that the state variable is relegated to a secondary status. This would be acceptable only if the decision on a control path $u(t)$ will, once given an initial condition on $y$, unambiguously determine a state-variable path $y(t)$ as a by-product. For this reason, an optimal control problem must contain an equation that relates $y$ to $u$:$$y’(t)=f[t,y(t),u(t))]$$ Such an equation, called an equation of motion (or transition equation or state equation), shows how, at any moment of time, given the value of the state variable, the planner’s choice of $u$ will drive the state variable y over time. Once we have found the optimal control-variable path $u^*(t)$, the equation of motion would make it possible to construct the related optimal state-variable path $y^*(t)$. Dynamic Programming:The most important distinguishing characteristics of this approach are two: First, it embeds the given control problem in a family of control problems, with the consequence that in solving the given problem, we are actually solving the entire family of problems. Second, for each member of this family of problems, primary attention is focused on the optimal value of the functional, $V^*$, rather than on the properties of the optimal state path $y^*(t)$ (as in the calculus of variations) or the optimal control path $u^*(t)$ (as in optimal control theory). Referring to Fig. 1.6 (adapted from Fig. 1.1), given the original problem of finding the least-cost path from point $A$ to point $Z$, we consider the larger problem of finding the least-cost path from each point in the set ${A, B, C, . . . , Z}$ to the terminal point $Z$. Since every component problem has a unique optimal path value, it is possible to write an optimal value function$$V^* = V^*(i)\\ \\ \\ \\ ( i = A, B, .. . , Z)$$ which says that we can determine an optimal path value for every possible initial point. From this, we can also construct an optimal policy function, which will tell us how best to proceed from any specific initial point $i$, in order to attain $V^*(i)$ by the proper selection of a sequence of arcs leading from point $i$ to the terminal point $Z$. Returning to Fig. 1.6, imagine that our immediate problem is merely that of determining the optimal values for stage 5, associated with the three initial points $I$, $J$, and $K$. The answer is easily seen to be$$V^*(I) = 3,\\ V^*(J) = 1,\\ V^*(K) =2\\tag{1.10}$$ Having found the optimal values for $I$, $J$, and $K$, the task of finding the least-cost values $V^*(G)$ and $V^*(H)$ becomes easier. Moving back to stage 4 and utilizing the previously obtained optimal-value information in (1.10), we can determine $V^*(G)$ as well as the optimal path $GZ$ (from $G$ to $Z$) as follows: $$\\begin{array}{} V^*(G)&amp;= \\min{\\mbox{value of arc }GI + V^*(I),\\mbox{ value of arc }GJ + V^*(J)}\\&amp;=\\min{2+ 3,8+1}=5 \\mbox{ [The optimal path GZ is GIZ.]}\\end{array}\\tag{1.11}$$ By the same token, we find$$\\begin{array}{} V^*(H)&amp;= \\min{\\mbox{value of arc }HJ + V^*(J),\\mbox{ value of arc }HK + V^*(K)}\\&amp;=\\min{4+ 1,6+2}=5 \\mbox{ [The optimal path HZ is HJZ.]}\\end{array}\\tag{1.12}$$ With the knowledge of $V^*(G)$ and $V^*(H)$, we can then move back one more stage to calculate $V^*(D), V^*(E)$, and $V^*(F)$-and the optimal paths $DZ, EZ$, and $FZ$-in a similar manner. And, with two more such steps, we will be back to stage 1, where we can determine $V^*(A)$ and the optimal path $AZ$, that is, solve the original given problem. The essence of the iterative solution procedure is captured in Bellman’s principle of optimality, which states, roughly, that if you chop off the first arc from an optimal sequence of arcs, the remaining abridged sequence must still be optimal in its own right-as an optimal path from its own initial point to the terminal point. If $EHJZ$ is the optimal path from $E$ to $Z$, for example, then $HJZ$ must be the optimal path from $H$ to $Z$. Conversely, if $HJZ$ is already known to be the optimal path from $H$ to $Z$, then a longer optimal path that passes through $H$ must use the sequence $HJZ$ at the tail end. This reasoning is behind the calculations in (1.11) and (1.12). But note that in order to apply the principle of optimality and the iterative procedure to delineate the optimal path from $A$ to $Z$, we must find the optimal value associated with every possible point in Fig. 1.6. This explains why we must embed the original problem. Even though the essence of dynamic programming is sufficiently clari­fied by the discrete example in Fig. 1.6, the full version of dynamic program­ ming includes the continuous-time case. Unfortunately, the solution of continuous-time problems of dynamic programming involves the more ad­vanced mathematical topic of partial differential equations. Besides, partial differential equations often do not yield analytical solutions. Reference Alpha C.

The task of variational calculus is to select from a set of admissible $y$ paths (or trajectories) the one that yields an extreme value of $V[y]$. Since the calculus of variations is based on the classical methods of calculus, requiring the use of first and second derivatives, we shall restrict the set of admissible paths to those continuous curves with continuous derivatives. A smooth $y$ path that yields an extremum of $V[y]$ is called an extremal. We shall also assume that the integrand function $F$ is twice differentiable. The Euler EquationDifferentiating a Definite Integral Considering the definite integral$$I(x)\\equiv \\int^b_aF(t,x)dt$$ We have the Leibnniz’s Rule $$\\frac{dI}{dx}=\\int^b_aF_x(t,x)dt$$ Considering another definite integral$$K(x)\\equiv\\int^{b(x)}_{a(x)}F(t,x)dt$$ We have $$\\frac{dK}{dx}=\\int^{b(x)}_{a(x)}F_x(t,x)dt+F[b(x),x]b’(x)-F[a(x),x]a’(x)$$ Development of the Euler EquationWith reference to Fig. 2.1, let the solid path $y^*(t)$ be a known extremal. We seek to find some property of the extremal that is absent in the (nonextremal) neighboring paths. Such a property would constitute a necessary condition for an extremal. To do this, we need for comparison purposes a family of neighboring paths which, by specification in (2.1), must pass through the given endpoints $(0, A)$ and $(T, Z)$. A simple way of generating such neighboring paths is by using a perturbing curve, chosen arbitrarily except for the restrictions that it be smooth and pass through the points $0$ and $T$ on the horizontal axis in Fig. 2.1. Consider a perturbing curve:$$p(0)=p(T)=0\\tag{2.2}$$Using the perturbing curve, we can generate neighboring paths of the extremal $y^*(t)$:$$\\begin{matrix} y(t)=y^{}(t)+\\epsilon p(t) &amp; \\mbox{ [implying}&amp; y’(t)={y^}’(t)+\\epsilon p’(t)] \\end{matrix}\\tag{2.3}$$ Instead of considering $V$ as a functional of $y$ path, now consider it as a function of the variable $\\epsilon$ $$V(\\epsilon)=\\int^T_0 F[y, y^{}(t)+\\epsilon p(t), {y^}’(t)+\\epsilon p’(t)]dt\\tag{2.12}$$ The necessary condition for the extremal is:$$\\frac{dV}{d\\epsilon}\\bigg\\vert_{\\epsilon=0}=0\\tag{2.4}$$ Then we have$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{dV}{d\\epsilon}&amp;=\\int^T_0\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\epsilon}dt=\\int^T_0\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{d\\epsilon}+\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}\\frac{dy'}{d\\epsilon}\\right)dt\\\\ &amp;=\\int^T_0[F_yp(t)+F_{y'}p'(t)]dt \\end{aligned}\\tag{2.13} $$ Breaking the integral into two parts$$\\int^T_0 F_yp(t)dt+\\int^T_0F_{y’}p’(t)dt=0\\tag{2.14}$$ While this form of necessary condition is already free of the arbitrary variable $\\epsilon$, the arbitrary perturbing curve $p(t)$ is still present along with its derivative $p’(t)$. To make the necessary condition fully operational, we must also eliminate $p(t)$ and $p’(t)$. Integration by parts$$\\begin{aligned} \\int^T_0F_{y'}p'(t)dt&amp;=[F_{y'}p(t)]^T_0-\\int^T_0 p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}dt\\\\ &amp;=-\\int^T_0p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}dt \\end{aligned}\\tag{2.16} $$ Another version of necessary condition for the extremal:$$\\int^T_0 p(t)\\left[F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’}\\right]dt=0\\tag{2.17}$$ Precisely because $p(t)$ enters in an arbitrary way, we may conclude that the condition $(2.17)$ can only be satisfied only if the bracketed expression is made to vanish for every value of $t$ on the extremal. Consequently, it is a necessary condition for an extremal that$$F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.18}$$ Break the second-order derivative into three parts:$$ \\frac{dF_{y'}}{dt}=\\frac{\\partial F_{y'}}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial F_{y'}}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt}+\\frac{\\partial F_{y'}}{\\partial y'}\\frac{dy'}{dt}=F_{ty'}+F_{yy'}y'(t)+F_{y'y'}y''(t) $$ We get the expanded version of Euler Equation:$$F_{y’y’}y’’(t)+F_{yy’}y’(t)+F_{ty’}-F_y=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.19}$$ The Euler equation is in general a second-order nonlinear differential equation. Its general solution will thus contain two arbitrary constants. Since our problem in (2.1) comes with two boundary conditions (one initial and one terminal), we should normally possess sufficient information to definitize the two arbitrary constants and obtain the definite solution. Some Special CasesSpecial Case I: $F=F(t,y’)$$$F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.18}$$ In this special case, the $F$ function is free of $y$, implying that $F_y=0$. Hence the Euler equation reduces to $\\frac{dF_{y’}}{dt}=0$, Hence the solution is$$F_{y'}=\\mbox{constant}\\tag{2.20} $$ Special Case II: $F=F(y,y’)$$$F_{y’y’}y’’(t)+F_{yy’}y’(t)+F_{ty’}-F_y=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.19}$$ Since $F$ is free of $t$ in this case, we have $F_{ty’}=0$, so the Euler equations reduces to$$ F_{y’y’}y’’(t)+F_{yy’}y’(t)-F_y=0$$ Note that$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{d}{dt}(y'F_{y'}-F)&amp;=\\frac{d}{dt}(y'F_{y'})-\\frac{d}{dt}F(y,y')\\\\ &amp;=F_{y'}{y''}+y'(F_{yy'}y'+F_{y'y'}y'')-(F_yy'+F_{y'}y'')\\\\ &amp;=y'(F_{y'y'}y''+F_{yy'}y'-F_y) \\end{aligned} $$ So the Euler equation can be written as $\\frac{d}{dt}(y’F_{y’}-F)=0$, which means$$F-y’F_{y’}=\\mbox{constant}\\tag{2.21}$$ Special Case III: $F=F(y’)$$$F_{y’y’}y’’(t)+F_{yy’}y’(t)+F_{ty’}-F_y=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.19}$$ When $F$ depends on $y’$ alone, $F_{yy’}=F_{ty’}=F_y=0$. And the Euler equation reduces to$$ F_{y'y'}y''(t)=0\\tag{2.24} $$ If $y’’(t)=0$, then $y’(t)=c_1$ and $y(t)=c_1t+c_2$. If $F_{y’y’}=0$, then since $F_{y’y’}$ is, like $F$ itself, a function of $y’$ alone, the solution of $F_{y’y’}=0$ should appear as specific values pf $y’$. Suppose there are one or more real solutions $y’=k_i$, then we can deduce that $y=k_it+c$, which again represents a family of straight lines. Consequently, given an integrand function that depends on $y’$ alone, we can always take its extermal to be a straight line. Special Case IV: $F=F(t,y)$$$F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.18}$$ Since $y’$ is missing from the $F$ function, we have $F_{y’}=0$, the Euler equation reduces to$$ F_y(t,y)=0 $$ The fact that the derivative $y’$ does not appear in this equation means that the Euler equation is not a differential equation. Since there are no arbitrary constraints in its solution to be definitized in accordance with the given boundary conditions, the extremal may not satisfy the boundary conditions except by sheer coincidence. Thus, $F(t,y)$ is, in a special sense, “linear” in $y’$.

Consequently, in order to satisfy the condition (3. 7)​, each of the three terms must individually be set equal to zero. When the first term in (3.7)​ is set equal to zero, the Euler equation emerges.$$F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.18}$$ This establish the fact that the Euler equation remains valid as a necessary condition in the variable-endpoint problem.

Its role is to take the place of the missing terminal condition in the present problem. Specialized Transversality ConditionsDepending on the exact specification of the terminal line or curve, however, the general condition (3.9) can be written in various specialized forms.

Since $t$ spans the interval $[0, T ]$, we have, of course, not one, but an infinite number of quadratic forms in the integral. Nevertheless, if it can be established that the quadratic form-with $F_{yy’}$, $F_{yy’}$, and $F_{y’y’}$ evaluated on the extremal-is negative definite for every $t$, then $\\frac{d^2V}{d\\epsilon^2} &lt; 0$, and the extremal maximizes $V$. Similarly, positive definiteness of the quadratic form for every $t$ is sufficient for minimization of $V$. Even if we can only establish sign semidefiniteness, we can at least have the second-order necessary conditions checked. For some reason, however, the quadratic-form test was totally ignored in the historical development of the classical calculus of variations. In a more recent development, however, the concavity / convexity of the integrand function $F$ is used in a sufficient condition. While concavity / convexity does not per se require differentiability, it is true that if the $F$ function does possess continuous second derivatives, then its concavity / convexity can be checked by means of the sign semidefiniteness of the second-order total differential of $F$. So the quadratic-form test definitely has a role to play in the calculus of variations. The Concavity / Convexity Sufficient ConditionA Sufficiency Theorem for Fixed-Endpoint Problems$$\\begin{array}{lll} \\mbox{Maximize or Minimize} &amp;V[y]=\\int^T_0 F[t,y(t),y’(t)]dt\\ \\ \\mbox{subject to}&amp; y(0)=A\\ &amp;(A\\ \\mbox{given})\\ \\ \\mbox{and }&amp;y(T)=Z\\ &amp;(T,Z\\ \\mbox{given})\\end{array}\\tag{2.1}$$ Just as a concave / convex objective function in a static optimization prob­ lem is sufficient to identify an extremum as an absolute maximum / mini­mum, a similar sufficiency theorem holds in the calculus of variations:$$\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\mbox{For the fixed-endpoint problem } (2.1), \\mbox{if the integrand function}\\ F(t,y,y’)\\ \\mbox{is concave} \\&amp;\\mbox{in the variables}\\ (y,y’), \\mbox{then the Euler equation is sufficient for an absolute}\\&amp;\\mbox{maximum of}\\ V[y].\\mbox{ Similarly, if}\\ F(t, y, y’)\\ \\mbox{is convex in}\\ (y, y’), \\mbox{then the Euler}\\&amp; \\mbox{equation is sufficient for an absolute minimum of}\\ V[y]. \\end{aligned}\\tag{4.3}$$ It should be pointed out that concavity / convexity in $(y,y’)$ means concavity / convexity in the two variables $y$ and $y’$ jointly, not in each variable separately. The proof of this theorem for the concave case.$$\\begin{aligned} F(t,y,y’)-F(t,y^*,{y^*}’)&amp;\\leq F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}’) (y-y^*)+F_{y’}(t,y^*,{y^*}’)(y’-{y^*}’)\\ &amp;= F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}’)\\epsilon p(t)+F_{y’}(t,y^*,{y^*})’\\epsilon p’(t) \\end{aligned}\\tag{4.4}$$ Recalling that$$ \\begin{aligned} \\int^T_0F_{y'}p'(t)dt&amp;=[F_{y'}p(t)]^T_0-\\int^T_0 p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}dt\\\\ &amp;=-\\int^T_0p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}dt \\end{aligned}\\tag{2.16} $$ And the Euler Equation$$ F_y-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T] $$ Integrate both sides of (4.4) with respect to $t$ over the interval $[0,T]$$$ \\begin{aligned} V[y]-V[y^*]&amp;\\leq \\epsilon\\int^T_0\\left[F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}')p(t)+F_{y'}(t,y^*,{y^*}')p'(t)\\right]dt\\\\ &amp;=\\epsilon \\int^T_0 p(t)\\left[F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}')-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}(t,y^*,{y^*}')\\right]dt\\\\ &amp;=0 \\end{aligned}\\tag{4.5} $$ The first equation follows from (2.16)​, the last equation follows from the fact that $y^*(t)$ satisfies the Euler Equation ​(2.18)​ Note that if the $F$ function is strictly concave in $(y, y’)$, then the weak inequality $\\leq$ in (4.4)​ and (4.5)​ will become the strict inequality $&lt;$. The result, $V[y] &lt; V[y^*]$, will then establish $V[y^*]$ to be a unique absolute maximum of $V$. By the same token, a strictly convex $F$ will make $V[y^*]$ a unique absolute minimum. Generalization to Variable Terminal PointRecalling$$\\begin{aligned} \\int^{T}0F{y’}p’(t)dt&amp;=[F_{y’}p(t)]^{T}0-\\int^{T}0 p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F{y’}dt\\ &amp;=[F{y’}]_{t={T}} p(T)-\\int^{T}0p(t)\\frac{d}{dt}F{y’}dt \\end{aligned}\\tag{2.16’}$$ Thus the Equation (4.5)​ becomes$$\\begin{aligned} V[y]-V[y^*]&amp;\\leq \\epsilon\\int^T_0\\left[F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}')p(t)+F_{y'}(t,y^*,{y^*}')p'(t)\\right]dt\\\\ &amp;=\\epsilon \\int^T_0 p(t)\\left[F_y(t,y^*,{y^*}')-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y'}(t,y^*,{y^*}')\\right]dt+\\epsilon[F_{y'}p(t)]_{t={T}}\\\\ &amp;=\\epsilon[F_{y'}p(t)]_{t={T}} \\\\ &amp;=[F_{y'}(y-y^*)]_{t={T}} \\end{aligned}\\tag{4.5'} $$ To ensure the maximum, $F(t, y, y’)$ in (4.3)​ only needs to be supplemented in the present case by a nonpositivity condition on the expression $[F_{y’}(y-y^*)]_{t={T}}$. But this supplementary condition is automatically met when the transversality condition is satisfied for the vertical-terminal-line problem, namely, $[F_{y’}]=0$. As for the truncated case, the transversality condition calls for either $[F_{y’}]=0$ (when the minimum acceptable terminal value is nobinding), or $y^*=y_{\\min}$ (when that terminal value is binding), thereby in effect turning the problem into one with a fixed terminal point). Either way, the supplementary condition is met. Thus, if the integrand function $F$ is concave / convex in the variables $(y,y’)$ in a problem with a vertical terminal lime or truncated vertical terminal line, then the Euler equation plus the transversality condition are sufficient for an absolute maximum / minimum of $V[y]$.

In the case where the integral diverges, there may exist more than one $y(t)$ path that yields an infinite value for the objective functional and it would be difficult to determine which among these paths is optimal. There are several certain conditions that are sufficient for convergence. Condition IGiven the improper integral $\\int^\\infty_0F(t, y, y’) dt$, if the integrand $F$ is finite throughout the interval of integration, and if $F$ attains a zero value at some finite point of time, say, $t_0$, and remains at zero for all $t &gt; t_0$, then the integral will converge. Although the integral nominally has an infinite horizon, the effective upper limit of integration is a finite value, $t_0$. Thus, the given improper integral reduces in effect to a proper one, with assurance that it will integrate to a finite value. Condition IIIIn the integral $\\int^\\infty_0F(t,y,y’)dt$, if the integrand takes the form of $G(t,y,y’)e^{-\\rho t}$, where $\\rho$ is a positive rate of discount, and the $G$ function is bounded, then the integral will converge. A distinguishing feature of this integral is the presence of the discount factor $e^{\\rho t}$ which, ceteris paribus, provides a dynamic force to drive the integrand down toward zero over time at a good speed. When the $G(t,y,y’)$ component of the integrand is positive (as in most economic applications) and has an upper hound, say, $\\hat{G}$, then the downward force of $e^\\rho t$ is sufficient to make the integral converge. More formally, since the value of the $G$ function can never exceed the value of the constant $\\hat{G}$, we can write$$ \\int^\\infty_0G(t,y,y')e^{-\\rho t}dt\\leq\\int^\\infty_0\\hat{G}e^{-\\rho t}dt=\\frac{\\hat{G}}{\\rho}\\tag{5.3} $$ It follows that the first integral must also be convergent.

Utility function $U(C)$ has nonincreasing marginal utility, $U’’(C)\\leq 0$ In order to produce its consumption goods, society incurs disutility of labor $D(L)$, with nondecreasing marginal utility, $D’’(L)\\geq 0$ The Question of ConvergenceThe absence of discount factor unfortunately forfeits the opportunity to take advantage of Condition III to establish convergence, even if the integrand has an upper bound. Thus replace (5.26)​ with the following substitute problem: $$\\begin{array}{lll} \\mbox{Minimize} &amp;\\int^\\infty_0[B-U(C)+D(L)]dt\\ \\ \\mbox{subject to} &amp;K(0)=K_0&amp;(K_0)\\ \\mbox{given} \\end{array}\\tag{5.26’}$$ where $B$ (for Bliss) is a postulated maximum attainable level of net utility. Condition I guarantees the convergence. The Solution of the ModelFrom (5.26’)​ we get$$F=B-U(C)+D(L)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{where}\\ C=Q(K,L)-K’$$ The derivative with respect to $L$ and $L’$:$$\\begin{aligned} &amp;F_L=-U'(C)\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial L}+D'(L)\\equiv-\\mu Q_L+D'(L)\\\\ &amp;F_{L'}=0 \\end{aligned} $$ The derivative with respect to $K$ and $K’$:$$ \\begin{aligned} &amp;F_K=-U'(C)\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial K}\\equiv-\\mu Q_K\\\\ &amp;F_{K'}=-U'(C)\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial K}=-U'(C)(-1)=\\mu \\end{aligned} $$ According to the Euler Equation$$F_{y_j}-\\frac{d}{dt}F_{y’_j}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all}\\ t\\in[0,T]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{ [Euler Equation]}\\tag{2.27}$$ we have$$ \\begin{aligned} &amp;F_L-\\frac{dF_{L'}}{dt}=0\\\\ &amp;F_K-\\frac{dF_{K'}}{dt}=0 \\end{aligned} $$ which means$$ D'(L)=\\mu Q_L\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all } t\\geq0\\tag{5.27} $$ $$\\frac{d\\mu/dt}{\\mu}=-Q_K\\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all } t\\geq0\\tag{5.28}$$ The marginal disutility of labor must, at each point of time, be equated to the product of the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal product of labor. The marginal utility of consumption, must at every point of time have a growth rate equal to the negative of the marginal product of capital. A Look at the Transversality Conditions$$\\lim_{t\\to \\infty}(F-y’F_{y’})=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [\\mbox{Transversalilty Condition for the Infinite Horizon}]\\tag{5.5}$$ When it is applied to two state variables, then we have $$\\lim_{t\\to \\infty}(F-L’F_{L’})=0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ and\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\lim_{t\\to \\infty}(F-K’F_{K’})=0$$ In view of the fact that $F_{L’} = 0$, the first of these conditions reduces to the condition that $F\\to 0$ as $t\\to\\infty$. This would mean the net utility $U(C) - D(L)$ must tend to Bliss. Note that, by itself, this condition still leaves the constant in (5.29)​ uncertain. However, the other condition will fix the constant at zero because $F - K’F_{K’}$ is nothing but the left-hand-side expression in (5.29)​. The present problem implicitly specifies the terminal state at Bliss. Consequently, the transversality condition (5.7) is not needed. The Optimal Investment and Capital PathsOf greater interest to us is the optimal $K$ path and the related investment (and savings) path $K’$. Instead of deducing these from the previous results, let us find this information by taking advantage of the fact that the present problem also falls under the Special Case II: $F=F(y,y’)$, which means $$F-K’F_{K’}=constant$$ or$$B-U(C)+D(L)-K’\\mu=constant\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for all } t\\geq0\\tag{5.29}$$ This equation can be solved for $K’$ as soon as the (arbitrary) constant on the right-hand side can be assigned a specific value. To find this value, we note that this constant is to hold for all $t$, including $t\\to\\infty$. We can thus make use of the fact that as $t\\to\\infty$, the economic objective of the model is to have $U(C) - D(L)$ tend to Bliss. As $t\\to\\infty$, $B-U(C)+D(L)\\to0$, $\\mu\\to0$, then we have the arbitrary constant has to be $0$. Thus $$ {K^*}’=\\frac{B-U(C)+D(L)}{\\mu}\\tag{5.30}$$ With the time argument explicitly written out,$${K^*}’(t)=\\frac{B-U[C(t)]+D[L(t)]}{\\mu(t)}\\tag{5.30’}$$ This result is known as the Ramsey rule. It stipulates that, optimally, the rate of capital accumulation must at any point of time be equal to the ratio of the shortfall of net utility from Bliss to the marginal utility of consumption. From the Ramsey rule, it is possible to go one step further to find the $K^*(t)$ path by integrating (5.30’)​. For that, however, we need specific forms of $U(C)$ and $D(L)$ functions. The general solution of (5.30’)​ will contain one arbitrary constant, which can be definitized by the initial condition $K(0) = K_0$. And that would complete the solution of the model. The Concavity / Convexity Sufficient Condition AgainSufficient Conditions​ Recall that if the integrand function $F(t,y,y’)$ in a fixed-endpoint problem is concave / convex in the variables $(y, y’)$, then the Euler equation is sufficient for an absolute maximum / minimum of $V[y]$. Moreover, this sufficiency condition remains applicable when the terminal time is fixed but the terminal state is variable, provided that the supplementary condition$$ [F_{y'}(y-y^*)]_{t={T}}\\leq 0 $$ is satisfied. For the infinite-horizon case, this supplementary becomes$$ \\lim_{t\\to \\infty}[F_{y'}(y-y^*)]\\leq 0\\tag{5.44} $$ In this condition, $F_{y’}$ is to be evaluated along the optimal path, and $(y-y^*)$ represents the deviation of any admissible neighboring path $y(t)$ from the optimal path $y^*(t)$.
